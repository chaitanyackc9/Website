This significantly lowers the barrier to systematicaly write unit tests for your project leading into improved overall code quality for real-world projects where developers don't always have the luxury to write unit test cases first.\n\nTo get started, read the documentation at the project home page below:\n\nhttps://github.com/JKISoftware/Caraya",

          "Release Notes": "- New toolkit and palette icon\n- Clearer UI to help spot the failed test\n- Clearer examples to help new users\n- Changed Label input of assert VIs to be recommended instead of optional\n- Changed non-palette VIs to be of private scope\n- Fixed an issue where an assert in a subVI of a test case incorrectly treated as a test\n",

Won't require downloads for every project, and the VIs can be used to compile multiple LabVIEW versions and bitnesses.  \r\n- Package installs to C:\\Users\\Public\\Documents\\LabVIEW Data\\Composed-CI\\ by default\r\n- Import Externals no longer attempts to relink or recompile, as it was giving inconsistent results.  It is left to the developer to relink everything.  We have had best luck with Tools->Clear Compiled Object Cache.\r\n\r\n## [1.3.1] - 2019-11-20\r\n### Changed\r\n- Moved gpm dependency location to remove requirement for recompile on package installation\r\n\r\n## [1.3.0] - 2019-09-28\r\n### Changed\r\n- added Report Errors.vi to CLI api vis so the exact error number and message are sent to the command line output\r\n- bunch of external dependency feature updates\r\n- changed VI Tester and VI Analyzer step calls in Configure Build.vi to be by reference\r\n- added dependencies vipc to the tools folder (in bitbucket source)\r\n\r\n## [1.2.0] - 2019-08-30\r\n### Added\r\n- improved open project log message, now lists specific bad vis it found\r\n- implemented 'import externals' as a method of adding private source code as a dependency via git, and resolving gpm dependencies and adding them to the parent project.  Specify a GIT URI to clone, or leave blank to read the externals.json file and import all.\r\n- fixed an issue with the project recompile sorting order\r\n- added cyclic dependency check to project recompile and open project steps\r\n- switched config file format to JSON using MGI json library.  Existing binary configurations can still be read, but not created.\r\n\r\n## [1.1.0] - 2019-04-25\r\n### Added\r\n- Added a new method called \"Recompile Project\" that will force a bottom-up recompile on all VIs in a project, including GPM dependencies.  This will fix any conflicts that may otherwise occur when opening the project and appear in the dependencies section.\r\n\r\n## [1.0.1] - 2019-04-17\r\n### Changed\r\n- fixed an issue where dependency order sorting in the relink step did not work for some packages\r\n\r\n## [1.0.0] - 2019-04-15\r\n### Changed\r\n- removed a breakpoint from manual build step that prevented builds from working\r\n- updated default value of build target to be 'my computer'\r\n- build step now creates zip files of build output\r\n- build output is left in place, in case it is needed by subsequent build specs\r\n- 'build specification names' no longer builds all if left blank.  Builds must be selected using the 'select build specs' button on the configure build UI\r\n\r\n## [0.9.17] - 2019-02-28\r\n### Changed\r\n- manual API methods now generate usefult errors if input paramaters are bad\r\n- improved test coverage for bad of missing configuration files\r\n- improved test coverage for bad or missing working directory\r\n- improved test coverage for VI tester steps, which must be run manually\r\n\r\n## [0.9.16] - 2019-02-28\r\n### Changed\r\n- renamed composed-ci.ini to composed-ci.cfg\r\n- added 'select build spec' button to UI\r\n- added 'select tests' button to UI and reworked the VI tester operation to use a folder and whitelist/blacklist\r\n### Removed\r\n- removed pipeline build step\r\n\r\n## [0.9.14] - 2019-02-26\r\n### Changed\r\n- removed dependency on ci-common-steps\r\n- updated documentation and icon/avatar\r\n- Open Project from CLI will return an error if <1 good VIs found or >0 bad VIs\r\n\r\n## [0.9.12] - 2019-02-25\r\n### Changed\r\n- small refactor from VIA feedback\r\n- added mass compile and relink steps to the CLI API\r\nsignificant rework of the sweet user interface, including new buttons for mass compile and relinking\r\n\r\n## [0.9.11] - 2019-02-19\r\n### Changed\r\n- updated composed-ci.ini\r\n- removed configuration.lvlib\r\n- removed dependency on @cs/configuration\r\n- added open project step\r\n- refactor due to new VIA configuration\r\n\r\n## [0.1.0] - 2019-02-7\r\n### Added\r\nInitial release\r\n\r\n## [Unreleased]\r\n### Added\r\n### Changed\r\n### Deprecated\r\n### Removed\r\n### Fixed\r\n### Security",

Don't ask how it works, because it's magic.\n\n<b>How to use this tool:<\/b>\nHit Ctrl+<space> to invoke QuickDrop then press Ctrl+F to invoke the Magic Delay Fairy and watch her do her magic. Before invoking the MDF, select error clusters to insert delays on error clusters, select objects to insert delays next to objects, or select nothing to place a delay on your block diagram. Delays are random, because that's how the magic works.\n\n<b>Thanks to:<\/b>\n- Norm Kirchner for doing the magic fairy dance\n- The guy whose face is on Norm's presentation about the Magic Delay Fairy (we'll update this description later)\n- Gavin Burnell for awesome Scripting Tools.\n- Brian Hoover (hooovahh) and Yair on LAVA for help getting screen coordinates of GObject on Block Diagram\n- Darren Nattinger (dnatt) for making QuickDrop awesomeness\n- Everyone at JKI who contributed to this tool.",

One possibility is to use this to identify bits of the block diagram of a vi for moving and rewiring via scripting.\n\nThe scripting Tools includes a separate XNode support library that provides routines to help scripting and terminal adaptation in XNodes.\n\nThere are some routines to help with undo transactions new to this release.\n\nNB If you are installing this with the Array XNodes (also from the Code repository) then I strongly recommend unzipping the two files into the same common directory and preserving the names. That should help linkage problems. \n\n",

Removed dependencies on OpenG array tools\n0.21.05 Add an additional XNode supprt vi to help on the GenerateCode ability. Create palette menu in VIPM\n0.21.04 Imporved the Set Tag on Selected Object Example to eliminate an error message when setting a tag for the first time and to run continuosly waiting for objects to be selected.\n0.21.03 Mad package name and product name consistent and added old name to Incompatible packages.\n0.21.02 Fixed a bug in checking if a variant type is sortable - complex numbers aren't (!) and clusters might be. Some cosmetic tidying up of front panels as well.\n0.21.01 Added a new routine to walk down a wire from a point and find all the terminals that are downstream.\n0.20.02 Repackaged as a VI Package Manager File with custom palette files installed in a LAVAG Category.\n0.20.01  Repackage for LV 8.6.1. Include menu files in the library.\n\tAdd a new palette of unfo control vis to control undo/redo operations in scripting.\n\tAdd a new palette of copy-paste control\n\tAdd a new Create Primitive by Enclosure vi that simulates drawing around the BD contents\n\tAdd some preliminary code for analysing and modifying structure tunnel properties - use default if not wired etc.\n\tAdd some more examples including a JKISoft RCF Framework plugin that will wrap the entire contents of a vi in an error cluster.\n0.18.01 Repackage for LV 8.5.1\n\tChange Create Free Text Label to polymorphic and add a polymorph for creating labels on block diagrams\n0.17.01 Adds another routine for XNode support to get the terminal descriptor from a vi reference.\n0.16.02 Update .opgb file to allow the library to be built as an OpenG package file for install via VIPM\n0.16.01\tMinor bug fixes, added a routine to convert a ref to an enum describing its class, reworked find all objects\n\tto get the selector tunnel of a case structure too. Added a number of routines to the XNode Support\n\tsub-library.\n0.15.01 Added new routines to tidy up wires and delete LV objects.\n\tAdded a new example that will take a selected case structure without a wire selector, looks for\n\tan error cluster wire that tunnels in and out, deletes the in tunnel and wires it to the selector\n\tinstead. This is for those situations when you realise you should have wrapped your vi in an error\n\tcase structure... !\n0.14.02 Fixed the cleanup wiring example by adding a routine to return references for wires specifically.\n0.14.01 Added a routine to create a free text label on a vi front panel.\n0.13.02 Added routines to create constants and controls/indicators from aribtary variant data. Reorganised some \n\tof the tagging support vi's out of private scope and renamed the misspelt private directory. Added a couple\n \tmore examples - one is a tool to set tags on selected elements for doing template based scripting and the\n\tother is a complete (although sparse) XNode that will test whether a single LVObject references, or an array\n\tof LVObject references can be cast to a specific type of reference. (Think about getting all objects in a\n\tdiagram and then filtering for those that are decorations, or sub-bi nodes or...). The Generate Code ability\n\tvi of this XNode demonstrates how to use a template vi with tagging to minise the hassle of generating code\n\tfor XNodes.\n\n\tThis release is in OpenG Package format\n0.12.01\tAdded a few new routines, one to expand a shift register, one to deterine if an object is selected,\n\tand a polymorphic vi that returns a reference of any given LVObject class (essentially wrapping\n\tclass specifier constants for all possible class types). Also added a couple of examples, including \n\tone that will do a clean up wire operation on all selected wires or all wires in the structure.\n0.11.01 Wrapped all vis in a case structure wired to error in for error handling\n\tadded a get sub-vi nodes in heirarchy and get all sub-vis routines\n\ttried to find and fix the worst wiring excesses\n0.10.04 Updated the README\n0.10.03 fixed a bug with the creation of (un)bundle by name nodes.\n0.10.02 fixes a couple of bugs, and adds some create bundle/unbundle node functions.\n0.10.01 Original release\n",

There was one more change that needed to be made, setting the Flatten Pointer and Include Private flags to true on the Read Attributes method within the Copy Linked List Attributes.vi.\r\n\r\n##[1.0.5] - 2019-08-01\r\n- Addresses [Issue #3](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-linked-lists/issues?status=new&status=open) - which is a bug that was reported in the Test Executive as [Issue #9](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-test-executive/issues/9/adding-a-subroutine-creates-an-empty).\r\n\r\n\r\n##[1.0.4] - 2019-08-01\r\n- Addresses [Issue #2](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-linked-lists/issues/2/prevent-the-build-tree-data-type-method) - which is a feature request to prevent the Build Tree Data Type method from showing the contents of a subroutine in the tree representing the linked list\r\n\r\n##[1.0.3] - 2019-07-30\r\n- Fixes an issue reported in the Test Executive (issue #5) where copying a test was not propagating the new GUID to the header, so when the test exec was saved to disk the copied element would hold the GUID of the item it was copied from.  It turns out that the bug was in the Linked List, and the root cause was that when a Linked List was copied the header object for the new linked list was not storing the new GUID.  This bug has been fixed and is covered by TestAPI_CopyLinkedList_HeaderGUID.vi\r\n\r\n##[1.0.2] - 2019-07-30\r\n- Fixes an issue reported in the Test Executive (issue #4) where copying a test was creating a blank attribute for that test.  It turns out that the bug was in the Linked List, and the root cause was that when a Linked List with a private attribute was copied the private attribute would copy over as an empty attribute.  This bug has been fixed and is covered by TestAPI_CopyLinkedList_PrivateAttributes.vi and TestAPI_CopyLinkedList_PublicAttributes.vi\r\n\r\n##[1.0.1] - 2019-07-24\r\n- Fixes a bug that was causing duplicates in the Attributes, Attribute Names, and Attribute IDs returned by the Get Child Attributes.vi of the Linked List class.  This was causing a problem with the Get List of Attributes by Type method of the by-ref class.\r\n\r\n## [1.0.0] - 2019-07-19\r\n- Initial Release\r\n- Fixes bug with Move Linked List method, attributes were being incorrectly copied to the destination parent on a move operation.\r\n\r\n## [0.0.38] - 2019-07-19\r\n- Last version before initial release",

The EOL Conversion was introducing issues in very specific circumstances with binary string data.\r\n\r\n##[1.2.2] - 2019-09-15\r\n- Fixed a bug in Set Attribute that was allowing a pointer value to be overwritten when a scalar value is inputted into an attribute that has been setup as a pointer\r\n- Updated Set Attribute to include a new input \"Update Pointer\" (default value is False).  Setting this flag to true for an attribute \"A\" that points to an attribute \"B\" will update the value of attribute \"B\".\r\n\r\n##[1.2.1] - 2019-09-09\r\n- Built against Look Up Table v0.1.0\r\n\r\n##[1.1.4] - 2019-09-05\r\n- Fixed a bug on Write Headers, an error will now be thrown if a bad GUID is passed in and the Linked List is not found\r\n- Fixed a bug on Write Name, an error will now be thrown if a bad GUID is passed in and the Linked List is not found\r\n\r\n##[1.1.3] - 2019-09-05\r\n- Fixed a bug on Move that was passing out the parent GUID instead of the moved items GUID\r\n- Fixed a bug on Add Linked List where the \"Replaced?\" flag output was hardcoded to False.\r\n\r\n##[1.1.2] - 2019-08-23\r\n- Refactored GUIDs so that they aren't GUID paths, now we are back to using GUIDs\r\n\r\n##[1.1.1] - 2019-08-23\r\n- Fixed an issue with copy and move where the Linked List definition was not being copied and/or moved with the Linked List\r\n\r\n##[1.1.0] - 2019-08-22\r\n- Refactored Linked Lists to use a GUID made up of a \"path\" of GUIDs built up from a Linked Lists ancestors GUIDs.  This is a big change but does not break backwards compatibility with other 1.x.x packages.\r\n\r\n##[1.0.9] - 2019-08-20\r\n- Fixed a bug with spaces in names of linked lists\r\n\r\n##[1.0.8] - 2019-08-20\r\n- Separated source from compiled code\r\n\r\n##[1.0.7] - 2019-08-19\r\n- Addresses [Issue #4](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-linked-lists/issues/4/formatting-of-spaces-when-saving-to-xml) - which is a bug that was reported in the Test Executive as [Issue #18](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-test-executive/issues/18/attribute-id-and-tag-name-mean-the-same).\r\n\r\n##[1.0.6] - 2019-08-01\r\n- Addresses [Issue #3](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-linked-lists/issues?status=new&status=open) - which is a bug that was reported in the Test Executive as [Issue #9](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-test-executive/issues/9/adding-a-subroutine-creates-an-empty).  There was still a bug in v1.0.5.  There was one more change that needed to be made, setting the Flatten Pointer and Include Private flags to true on the Read Attributes method within the Copy Linked List Attributes.vi.\r\n\r\n##[1.0.5] - 2019-08-01\r\n- Addresses [Issue #3](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-linked-lists/issues?status=new&status=open) - which is a bug that was reported in the Test Executive as [Issue #9](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-test-executive/issues/9/adding-a-subroutine-creates-an-empty).\r\n\r\n\r\n##[1.0.4] - 2019-08-01\r\n- Addresses [Issue #2](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-linked-lists/issues/2/prevent-the-build-tree-data-type-method) - which is a feature request to prevent the Build Tree Data Type method from showing the contents of a subroutine in the tree representing the linked list\r\n\r\n##[1.0.3] - 2019-07-30\r\n- Fixes an issue reported in the Test Executive (issue #5) where copying a test was not propagating the new GUID to the header, so when the test exec was saved to disk the copied element would hold the GUID of the item it was copied from.  It turns out that the bug was in the Linked List, and the root cause was that when a Linked List was copied the header object for the new linked list was not storing the new GUID.  This bug has been fixed and is covered by TestAPI_CopyLinkedList_HeaderGUID.vi\r\n\r\n##[1.0.2] - 2019-07-30\r\n- Fixes an issue reported in the Test Executive (issue #4) where copying a test was creating a blank attribute for that test.  It turns out that the bug was in the Linked List, and the root cause was that when a Linked List with a private attribute was copied the private attribute would copy over as an empty attribute.  This bug has been fixed and is covered by TestAPI_CopyLinkedList_PrivateAttributes.vi and TestAPI_CopyLinkedList_PublicAttributes.vi\r\n\r\n##[1.0.1] - 2019-07-24\r\n- Fixes a bug that was causing duplicates in the Attributes, Attribute Names, and Attribute IDs returned by the Get Child Attributes.vi of the Linked List class.  This was causing a problem with the Get List of Attributes by Type method of the by-ref class.\r\n\r\n## [1.0.0] - 2019-07-19\r\n- Initial Release\r\n- Fixes bug with Move Linked List method, attributes were being incorrectly copied to the destination parent on a move operation.\r\n\r\n## [0.0.38] - 2019-07-19\r\n- Last version before initial release",

This is a big change but does not break backwards compatibility with other 1.x.x packages.\r\n\r\n##[1.0.9] - 2019-08-20\r\n- Fixed a bug with spaces in names of linked lists\r\n\r\n##[1.0.8] - 2019-08-20\r\n- Separated source from compiled code\r\n\r\n##[1.0.7] - 2019-08-19\r\n- Addresses [Issue #4](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-linked-lists/issues/4/formatting-of-spaces-when-saving-to-xml) - which is a bug that was reported in the Test Executive as [Issue #18](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-test-executive/issues/18/attribute-id-and-tag-name-mean-the-same).\r\n\r\n##[1.0.6] - 2019-08-01\r\n- Addresses [Issue #3](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-linked-lists/issues?status=new&status=open) - which is a bug that was reported in the Test Executive as [Issue #9](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-test-executive/issues/9/adding-a-subroutine-creates-an-empty).  There was still a bug in v1.0.5.  There was one more change that needed to be made, setting the Flatten Pointer and Include Private flags to true on the Read Attributes method within the Copy Linked List Attributes.vi.\r\n\r\n##[1.0.5] - 2019-08-01\r\n- Addresses [Issue #3](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-linked-lists/issues?status=new&status=open) - which is a bug that was reported in the Test Executive as [Issue #9](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-test-executive/issues/9/adding-a-subroutine-creates-an-empty).\r\n\r\n\r\n##[1.0.4] - 2019-08-01\r\n- Addresses [Issue #2](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-linked-lists/issues/2/prevent-the-build-tree-data-type-method) - which is a feature request to prevent the Build Tree Data Type method from showing the contents of a subroutine in the tree representing the linked list\r\n\r\n##[1.0.3] - 2019-07-30\r\n- Fixes an issue reported in the Test Executive (issue #5) where copying a test was not propagating the new GUID to the header, so when the test exec was saved to disk the copied element would hold the GUID of the item it was copied from.  It turns out that the bug was in the Linked List, and the root cause was that when a Linked List was copied the header object for the new linked list was not storing the new GUID.  This bug has been fixed and is covered by TestAPI_CopyLinkedList_HeaderGUID.vi\r\n\r\n##[1.0.2] - 2019-07-30\r\n- Fixes an issue reported in the Test Executive (issue #4) where copying a test was creating a blank attribute for that test.  It turns out that the bug was in the Linked List, and the root cause was that when a Linked List with a private attribute was copied the private attribute would copy over as an empty attribute.  This bug has been fixed and is covered by TestAPI_CopyLinkedList_PrivateAttributes.vi and TestAPI_CopyLinkedList_PublicAttributes.vi\r\n\r\n##[1.0.1] - 2019-07-24\r\n- Fixes a bug that was causing duplicates in the Attributes, Attribute Names, and Attribute IDs returned by the Get Child Attributes.vi of the Linked List class.  This was causing a problem with the Get List of Attributes by Type method of the by-ref class.\r\n\r\n## [1.0.0] - 2019-07-19\r\n- Initial Release\r\n- Fixes bug with Move Linked List method, attributes were being incorrectly copied to the destination parent on a move operation.\r\n\r\n## [0.0.38] - 2019-07-19\r\n- Last version before initial release",

          "Release Notes": "##[1.7.0] - 2020-05-04\r\n- Seperated the persistence bits into their own package\r\n- Depends on a data serialization package because binary strings dont work well when going between Windows and RT\r\n\r\n##[1.6.0] - 2020-03-17\r\n- There was a bug with copying an entire Linked List (as opposed to just lists within the greate linked list), this version fixes that bug so that top level linked list copy operations generate new GUIDs for the entire linked list.\r\n\r\n##[1.5.11] - 2019-12-20\r\n- Updated Format Attribute String to do a string length check on arrays flattened XML to prevent crashes on search for end of line.\r\n\r\n##[1.5.10] - 2019-12-2\r\n- Added ability to delete multiple attributes at once.\r\n\r\n##[1.5.9] - 2019-10-29\r\n- Added tag of \"5\" to attribute in build tree data.\r\n\r\n##[1.5.8] - 2019-10-28\r\n- Added read and write methods for attribute meta data to the by-ref class.\r\n\r\n##[1.5.7] - 2019-10-28\r\n- Added read and write methods for meta data to the by-ref class.\r\n\r\n##[1.5.6] - 2019-10-24\r\n- Project relink.\r\n\r\n##[1.5.5] - 2019-10-24\r\n- Mass Compile.\r\n\r\n##[1.5.4] - 2019-10-22\r\n- Bug Fix: The GUID comparison for orphaned pointers was being done incorrectly.\r\n\r\n##[1.5.3] - 2019-10-22\r\n- Added by ref wrapper for orphaned pointer search (see 1.5.0).\r\n\r\n##[1.5.2] - 2019-10-22\r\n- Bug fix: forgot to wire the \"Recurse\" flag at the by ref layer of the linked list.\r\n\r\n##[1.5.1] - 2019-10-22\r\n- Refactored the Copy Linked List method so that recursing through children of the copied Linked List optional, set by a flag.  The default value for the flag is True to keep backwards compatibility.\r\n\r\n##[1.5.0] - 2019-10-21\r\n- Added ability to search for ophaned pointers.\r\n\r\n##[1.4.7] - 2019-10-16\r\n- Refactored error propagation in reentrant VI's so that errors stack up instead of halting recursion\r\n\r\n##[1.4.6] - 2019-10-16\r\n- Fixed a bug in the XML Persist class, where attribute values saved as strings in the header were causing errors on load when the string value contained non alphanumeric characters\r\n\r\n##[1.4.5] - 2019-10-08\r\n- Mass Compile\r\n\r\n##[1.4.4] - 2019-10-07\r\n- Refactored ability for attributes to store their value as well as their type in the xml persistence type, previously complex data types were being flattened to XML which was causing errors in the persistence parser - Needed to specifically address the Refnum type\r\n\r\n##[1.4.3] - 2019-10-07\r\n- Refactored ability for attributes to store their value as well as their type in the xml persistence type, previously complex data types were being flattened to XML which was causing errors in the persistence parser\r\n\r\n##[1.4.2] - 2019-10-07\r\n- Added ability for attributes to store their value as well as their type in the xml persistence type\r\n\r\n##[1.4.1] - 2019-10-07\r\n- Fixed a bug in the Build Tree Data method that was causing the tree data builder to hang on complex data types\r\n\r\n##[1.4.0] - 2019-10-04\r\n- Moved file IO from Linked List library into Persistence library.\r\n- Updated color of Linked List Parent wire so that it isn't black and white\r\n\r\n##[1.3.0] - 2019-09-19\r\n- Unchecked \"Convert EOL\" for Saving and Loading the Linked List to and from disk.  The EOL Conversion was introducing issues in very specific circumstances with binary string data.\r\n\r\n##[1.2.2] - 2019-09-15\r\n- Fixed a bug in Set Attribute that was allowing a pointer value to be overwritten when a scalar value is inputted into an attribute that has been setup as a pointer\r\n- Updated Set Attribute to include a new input \"Update Pointer\" (default value is False).  Setting this flag to true for an attribute \"A\" that points to an attribute \"B\" will update the value of attribute \"B\".\r\n\r\n##[1.2.1] - 2019-09-09\r\n- Built against Look Up Table v0.1.0\r\n\r\n##[1.1.4] - 2019-09-05\r\n- Fixed a bug on Write Headers, an error will now be thrown if a bad GUID is passed in and the Linked List is not found\r\n- Fixed a bug on Write Name, an error will now be thrown if a bad GUID is passed in and the Linked List is not found\r\n\r\n##[1.1.3] - 2019-09-05\r\n- Fixed a bug on Move that was passing out the parent GUID instead of the moved items GUID\r\n- Fixed a bug on Add Linked List where the \"Replaced?\" flag output was hardcoded to False.\r\n\r\n##[1.1.2] - 2019-08-23\r\n- Refactored GUIDs so that they aren't GUID paths, now we are back to using GUIDs\r\n\r\n##[1.1.1] - 2019-08-23\r\n- Fixed an issue with copy and move where the Linked List definition was not being copied and/or moved with the Linked List\r\n\r\n##[1.1.0] - 2019-08-22\r\n- Refactored Linked Lists to use a GUID made up of a \"path\" of GUIDs built up from a Linked Lists ancestors GUIDs.  This is a big change but does not break backwards compatibility with other 1.x.x packages.\r\n\r\n##[1.0.9] - 2019-08-20\r\n- Fixed a bug with spaces in names of linked lists\r\n\r\n##[1.0.8] - 2019-08-20\r\n- Separated source from compiled code\r\n\r\n##[1.0.7] - 2019-08-19\r\n- Addresses [Issue #4](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-linked-lists/issues/4/formatting-of-spaces-when-saving-to-xml) - which is a bug that was reported in the Test Executive as [Issue #18](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-test-executive/issues/18/attribute-id-and-tag-name-mean-the-same).\r\n\r\n##[1.0.6] - 2019-08-01\r\n- Addresses [Issue #3](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-linked-lists/issues?status=new&status=open) - which is a bug that was reported in the Test Executive as [Issue #9](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-test-executive/issues/9/adding-a-subroutine-creates-an-empty).  There was still a bug in v1.0.5.  There was one more change that needed to be made, setting the Flatten Pointer and Include Private flags to true on the Read Attributes method within the Copy Linked List Attributes.vi.\r\n\r\n##[1.0.5] - 2019-08-01\r\n- Addresses [Issue #3](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-linked-lists/issues?status=new&status=open) - which is a bug that was reported in the Test Executive as [Issue #9](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-test-executive/issues/9/adding-a-subroutine-creates-an-empty).\r\n\r\n\r\n##[1.0.4] - 2019-08-01\r\n- Addresses [Issue #2](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-linked-lists/issues/2/prevent-the-build-tree-data-type-method) - which is a feature request to prevent the Build Tree Data Type method from showing the contents of a subroutine in the tree representing the linked list\r\n\r\n##[1.0.3] - 2019-07-30\r\n- Fixes an issue reported in the Test Executive (issue #5) where copying a test was not propagating the new GUID to the header, so when the test exec was saved to disk the copied element would hold the GUID of the item it was copied from.  It turns out that the bug was in the Linked List, and the root cause was that when a Linked List was copied the header object for the new linked list was not storing the new GUID.  This bug has been fixed and is covered by TestAPI_CopyLinkedList_HeaderGUID.vi\r\n\r\n##[1.0.2] - 2019-07-30\r\n- Fixes an issue reported in the Test Executive (issue #4) where copying a test was creating a blank attribute for that test.  It turns out that the bug was in the Linked List, and the root cause was that when a Linked List with a private attribute was copied the private attribute would copy over as an empty attribute.  This bug has been fixed and is covered by TestAPI_CopyLinkedList_PrivateAttributes.vi and TestAPI_CopyLinkedList_PublicAttributes.vi\r\n\r\n##[1.0.1] - 2019-07-24\r\n- Fixes a bug that was causing duplicates in the Attributes, Attribute Names, and Attribute IDs returned by the Get Child Attributes.vi of the Linked List class.  This was causing a problem with the Get List of Attributes by Type method of the by-ref class.\r\n\r\n## [1.0.0] - 2019-07-19\r\n- Initial Release\r\n- Fixes bug with Move Linked List method, attributes were being incorrectly copied to the destination parent on a move operation.\r\n\r\n## [0.0.38] - 2019-07-19\r\n- Last version before initial release",

There was one more change that needed to be made, setting the Flatten Pointer and Include Private flags to true on the Read Attributes method within the Copy Linked List Attributes.vi.\r\n\r\n##[1.0.5] - 2019-08-01\r\n- Addresses [Issue #3](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-linked-lists/issues?status=new&status=open) - which is a bug that was reported in the Test Executive as [Issue #9](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-test-executive/issues/9/adding-a-subroutine-creates-an-empty).\r\n\r\n\r\n##[1.0.4] - 2019-08-01\r\n- Addresses [Issue #2](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-linked-lists/issues/2/prevent-the-build-tree-data-type-method) - which is a feature request to prevent the Build Tree Data Type method from showing the contents of a subroutine in the tree representing the linked list\r\n\r\n##[1.0.3] - 2019-07-30\r\n- Fixes an issue reported in the Test Executive (issue #5) where copying a test was not propagating the new GUID to the header, so when the test exec was saved to disk the copied element would hold the GUID of the item it was copied from.  It turns out that the bug was in the Linked List, and the root cause was that when a Linked List was copied the header object for the new linked list was not storing the new GUID.  This bug has been fixed and is covered by TestAPI_CopyLinkedList_HeaderGUID.vi\r\n\r\n##[1.0.2] - 2019-07-30\r\n- Fixes an issue reported in the Test Executive (issue #4) where copying a test was creating a blank attribute for that test.  It turns out that the bug was in the Linked List, and the root cause was that when a Linked List with a private attribute was copied the private attribute would copy over as an empty attribute.  This bug has been fixed and is covered by TestAPI_CopyLinkedList_PrivateAttributes.vi and TestAPI_CopyLinkedList_PublicAttributes.vi\r\n\r\n##[1.0.1] - 2019-07-24\r\n- Fixes a bug that was causing duplicates in the Attributes, Attribute Names, and Attribute IDs returned by the Get Child Attributes.vi of the Linked List class.  This was causing a problem with the Get List of Attributes by Type method of the by-ref class.\r\n\r\n## [1.0.0] - 2019-07-19\r\n- Initial Release\r\n- Fixes bug with Move Linked List method, attributes were being incorrectly copied to the destination parent on a move operation.\r\n\r\n## [0.0.38] - 2019-07-19\r\n- Last version before initial release",

Setting this flag to true for an attribute \"A\" that points to an attribute \"B\" will update the value of attribute \"B\".\r\n\r\n##[1.2.1] - 2019-09-09\r\n- Built against Look Up Table v0.1.0\r\n\r\n##[1.1.4] - 2019-09-05\r\n- Fixed a bug on Write Headers, an error will now be thrown if a bad GUID is passed in and the Linked List is not found\r\n- Fixed a bug on Write Name, an error will now be thrown if a bad GUID is passed in and the Linked List is not found\r\n\r\n##[1.1.3] - 2019-09-05\r\n- Fixed a bug on Move that was passing out the parent GUID instead of the moved items GUID\r\n- Fixed a bug on Add Linked List where the \"Replaced?\" flag output was hardcoded to False.\r\n\r\n##[1.1.2] - 2019-08-23\r\n- Refactored GUIDs so that they aren't GUID paths, now we are back to using GUIDs\r\n\r\n##[1.1.1] - 2019-08-23\r\n- Fixed an issue with copy and move where the Linked List definition was not being copied and/or moved with the Linked List\r\n\r\n##[1.1.0] - 2019-08-22\r\n- Refactored Linked Lists to use a GUID made up of a \"path\" of GUIDs built up from a Linked Lists ancestors GUIDs.  This is a big change but does not break backwards compatibility with other 1.x.x packages.\r\n\r\n##[1.0.9] - 2019-08-20\r\n- Fixed a bug with spaces in names of linked lists\r\n\r\n##[1.0.8] - 2019-08-20\r\n- Separated source from compiled code\r\n\r\n##[1.0.7] - 2019-08-19\r\n- Addresses [Issue #4](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-linked-lists/issues/4/formatting-of-spaces-when-saving-to-xml) - which is a bug that was reported in the Test Executive as [Issue #18](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-test-executive/issues/18/attribute-id-and-tag-name-mean-the-same).\r\n\r\n##[1.0.6] - 2019-08-01\r\n- Addresses [Issue #3](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-linked-lists/issues?status=new&status=open) - which is a bug that was reported in the Test Executive as [Issue #9](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-test-executive/issues/9/adding-a-subroutine-creates-an-empty).  There was still a bug in v1.0.5.  There was one more change that needed to be made, setting the Flatten Pointer and Include Private flags to true on the Read Attributes method within the Copy Linked List Attributes.vi.\r\n\r\n##[1.0.5] - 2019-08-01\r\n- Addresses [Issue #3](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-linked-lists/issues?status=new&status=open) - which is a bug that was reported in the Test Executive as [Issue #9](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-test-executive/issues/9/adding-a-subroutine-creates-an-empty).\r\n\r\n\r\n##[1.0.4] - 2019-08-01\r\n- Addresses [Issue #2](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-linked-lists/issues/2/prevent-the-build-tree-data-type-method) - which is a feature request to prevent the Build Tree Data Type method from showing the contents of a subroutine in the tree representing the linked list\r\n\r\n##[1.0.3] - 2019-07-30\r\n- Fixes an issue reported in the Test Executive (issue #5) where copying a test was not propagating the new GUID to the header, so when the test exec was saved to disk the copied element would hold the GUID of the item it was copied from.  It turns out that the bug was in the Linked List, and the root cause was that when a Linked List was copied the header object for the new linked list was not storing the new GUID.  This bug has been fixed and is covered by TestAPI_CopyLinkedList_HeaderGUID.vi\r\n\r\n##[1.0.2] - 2019-07-30\r\n- Fixes an issue reported in the Test Executive (issue #4) where copying a test was creating a blank attribute for that test.  It turns out that the bug was in the Linked List, and the root cause was that when a Linked List with a private attribute was copied the private attribute would copy over as an empty attribute.  This bug has been fixed and is covered by TestAPI_CopyLinkedList_PrivateAttributes.vi and TestAPI_CopyLinkedList_PublicAttributes.vi\r\n\r\n##[1.0.1] - 2019-07-24\r\n- Fixes a bug that was causing duplicates in the Attributes, Attribute Names, and Attribute IDs returned by the Get Child Attributes.vi of the Linked List class.  This was causing a problem with the Get List of Attributes by Type method of the by-ref class.\r\n\r\n## [1.0.0] - 2019-07-19\r\n- Initial Release\r\n- Fixes bug with Move Linked List method, attributes were being incorrectly copied to the destination parent on a move operation.\r\n\r\n## [0.0.38] - 2019-07-19\r\n- Last version before initial release",

The EOL Conversion was introducing issues in very specific circumstances with binary string data.\r\n\r\n##[1.2.2] - 2019-09-15\r\n- Fixed a bug in Set Attribute that was allowing a pointer value to be overwritten when a scalar value is inputted into an attribute that has been setup as a pointer\r\n- Updated Set Attribute to include a new input \"Update Pointer\" (default value is False).  Setting this flag to true for an attribute \"A\" that points to an attribute \"B\" will update the value of attribute \"B\".\r\n\r\n##[1.2.1] - 2019-09-09\r\n- Built against Look Up Table v0.1.0\r\n\r\n##[1.1.4] - 2019-09-05\r\n- Fixed a bug on Write Headers, an error will now be thrown if a bad GUID is passed in and the Linked List is not found\r\n- Fixed a bug on Write Name, an error will now be thrown if a bad GUID is passed in and the Linked List is not found\r\n\r\n##[1.1.3] - 2019-09-05\r\n- Fixed a bug on Move that was passing out the parent GUID instead of the moved items GUID\r\n- Fixed a bug on Add Linked List where the \"Replaced?\" flag output was hardcoded to False.\r\n\r\n##[1.1.2] - 2019-08-23\r\n- Refactored GUIDs so that they aren't GUID paths, now we are back to using GUIDs\r\n\r\n##[1.1.1] - 2019-08-23\r\n- Fixed an issue with copy and move where the Linked List definition was not being copied and/or moved with the Linked List\r\n\r\n##[1.1.0] - 2019-08-22\r\n- Refactored Linked Lists to use a GUID made up of a \"path\" of GUIDs built up from a Linked Lists ancestors GUIDs.  This is a big change but does not break backwards compatibility with other 1.x.x packages.\r\n\r\n##[1.0.9] - 2019-08-20\r\n- Fixed a bug with spaces in names of linked lists\r\n\r\n##[1.0.8] - 2019-08-20\r\n- Separated source from compiled code\r\n\r\n##[1.0.7] - 2019-08-19\r\n- Addresses [Issue #4](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-linked-lists/issues/4/formatting-of-spaces-when-saving-to-xml) - which is a bug that was reported in the Test Executive as [Issue #18](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-test-executive/issues/18/attribute-id-and-tag-name-mean-the-same).\r\n\r\n##[1.0.6] - 2019-08-01\r\n- Addresses [Issue #3](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-linked-lists/issues?status=new&status=open) - which is a bug that was reported in the Test Executive as [Issue #9](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-test-executive/issues/9/adding-a-subroutine-creates-an-empty).  There was still a bug in v1.0.5.  There was one more change that needed to be made, setting the Flatten Pointer and Include Private flags to true on the Read Attributes method within the Copy Linked List Attributes.vi.\r\n\r\n##[1.0.5] - 2019-08-01\r\n- Addresses [Issue #3](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-linked-lists/issues?status=new&status=open) - which is a bug that was reported in the Test Executive as [Issue #9](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-test-executive/issues/9/adding-a-subroutine-creates-an-empty).\r\n\r\n\r\n##[1.0.4] - 2019-08-01\r\n- Addresses [Issue #2](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-linked-lists/issues/2/prevent-the-build-tree-data-type-method) - which is a feature request to prevent the Build Tree Data Type method from showing the contents of a subroutine in the tree representing the linked list\r\n\r\n##[1.0.3] - 2019-07-30\r\n- Fixes an issue reported in the Test Executive (issue #5) where copying a test was not propagating the new GUID to the header, so when the test exec was saved to disk the copied element would hold the GUID of the item it was copied from.  It turns out that the bug was in the Linked List, and the root cause was that when a Linked List was copied the header object for the new linked list was not storing the new GUID.  This bug has been fixed and is covered by TestAPI_CopyLinkedList_HeaderGUID.vi\r\n\r\n##[1.0.2] - 2019-07-30\r\n- Fixes an issue reported in the Test Executive (issue #4) where copying a test was creating a blank attribute for that test.  It turns out that the bug was in the Linked List, and the root cause was that when a Linked List with a private attribute was copied the private attribute would copy over as an empty attribute.  This bug has been fixed and is covered by TestAPI_CopyLinkedList_PrivateAttributes.vi and TestAPI_CopyLinkedList_PublicAttributes.vi\r\n\r\n##[1.0.1] - 2019-07-24\r\n- Fixes a bug that was causing duplicates in the Attributes, Attribute Names, and Attribute IDs returned by the Get Child Attributes.vi of the Linked List class.  This was causing a problem with the Get List of Attributes by Type method of the by-ref class.\r\n\r\n## [1.0.0] - 2019-07-19\r\n- Initial Release\r\n- Fixes bug with Move Linked List method, attributes were being incorrectly copied to the destination parent on a move operation.\r\n\r\n## [0.0.38] - 2019-07-19\r\n- Last version before initial release",

It turns out that the bug was in the Linked List, and the root cause was that when a Linked List with a private attribute was copied the private attribute would copy over as an empty attribute.  This bug has been fixed and is covered by TestAPI_CopyLinkedList_PrivateAttributes.vi and TestAPI_CopyLinkedList_PublicAttributes.vi\r\n\r\n##[1.0.1] - 2019-07-24\r\n- Fixes a bug that was causing duplicates in the Attributes, Attribute Names, and Attribute IDs returned by the Get Child Attributes.vi of the Linked List class.  This was causing a problem with the Get List of Attributes by Type method of the by-ref class.\r\n\r\n## [1.0.0] - 2019-07-19\r\n- Initial Release\r\n- Fixes bug with Move Linked List method, attributes were being incorrectly copied to the destination parent on a move operation.\r\n\r\n## [0.0.38] - 2019-07-19\r\n- Last version before initial release",

The default value for the flag is True to keep backwards compatibility.\r\n\r\n##[1.5.0] - 2019-10-21\r\n- Added ability to search for ophaned pointers.\r\n\r\n##[1.4.7] - 2019-10-16\r\n- Refactored error propagation in reentrant VI's so that errors stack up instead of halting recursion\r\n\r\n##[1.4.6] - 2019-10-16\r\n- Fixed a bug in the XML Persist class, where attribute values saved as strings in the header were causing errors on load when the string value contained non alphanumeric characters\r\n\r\n##[1.4.5] - 2019-10-08\r\n- Mass Compile\r\n\r\n##[1.4.4] - 2019-10-07\r\n- Refactored ability for attributes to store their value as well as their type in the xml persistence type, previously complex data types were being flattened to XML which was causing errors in the persistence parser - Needed to specifically address the Refnum type\r\n\r\n##[1.4.3] - 2019-10-07\r\n- Refactored ability for attributes to store their value as well as their type in the xml persistence type, previously complex data types were being flattened to XML which was causing errors in the persistence parser\r\n\r\n##[1.4.2] - 2019-10-07\r\n- Added ability for attributes to store their value as well as their type in the xml persistence type\r\n\r\n##[1.4.1] - 2019-10-07\r\n- Fixed a bug in the Build Tree Data method that was causing the tree data builder to hang on complex data types\r\n\r\n##[1.4.0] - 2019-10-04\r\n- Moved file IO from Linked List library into Persistence library.\r\n- Updated color of Linked List Parent wire so that it isn't black and white\r\n\r\n##[1.3.0] - 2019-09-19\r\n- Unchecked \"Convert EOL\" for Saving and Loading the Linked List to and from disk.  The EOL Conversion was introducing issues in very specific circumstances with binary string data.\r\n\r\n##[1.2.2] - 2019-09-15\r\n- Fixed a bug in Set Attribute that was allowing a pointer value to be overwritten when a scalar value is inputted into an attribute that has been setup as a pointer\r\n- Updated Set Attribute to include a new input \"Update Pointer\" (default value is False).  Setting this flag to true for an attribute \"A\" that points to an attribute \"B\" will update the value of attribute \"B\".\r\n\r\n##[1.2.1] - 2019-09-09\r\n- Built against Look Up Table v0.1.0\r\n\r\n##[1.1.4] - 2019-09-05\r\n- Fixed a bug on Write Headers, an error will now be thrown if a bad GUID is passed in and the Linked List is not found\r\n- Fixed a bug on Write Name, an error will now be thrown if a bad GUID is passed in and the Linked List is not found\r\n\r\n##[1.1.3] - 2019-09-05\r\n- Fixed a bug on Move that was passing out the parent GUID instead of the moved items GUID\r\n- Fixed a bug on Add Linked List where the \"Replaced?\" flag output was hardcoded to False.\r\n\r\n##[1.1.2] - 2019-08-23\r\n- Refactored GUIDs so that they aren't GUID paths, now we are back to using GUIDs\r\n\r\n##[1.1.1] - 2019-08-23\r\n- Fixed an issue with copy and move where the Linked List definition was not being copied and/or moved with the Linked List\r\n\r\n##[1.1.0] - 2019-08-22\r\n- Refactored Linked Lists to use a GUID made up of a \"path\" of GUIDs built up from a Linked Lists ancestors GUIDs.

It turns out that the bug was in the Linked List, and the root cause was that when a Linked List with a private attribute was copied the private attribute would copy over as an empty attribute.  This bug has been fixed and is covered by TestAPI_CopyLinkedList_PrivateAttributes.vi and TestAPI_CopyLinkedList_PublicAttributes.vi\r\n\r\n##[1.0.1] - 2019-07-24\r\n- Fixes a bug that was causing duplicates in the Attributes, Attribute Names, and Attribute IDs returned by the Get Child Attributes.vi of the Linked List class.

The EOL Conversion was introducing issues in very specific circumstances with binary string data.\r\n\r\n##[1.2.2] - 2019-09-15\r\n- Fixed a bug in Set Attribute that was allowing a pointer value to be overwritten when a scalar value is inputted into an attribute that has been setup as a pointer\r\n- Updated Set Attribute to include a new input \"Update Pointer\" (default value is False).  Setting this flag to true for an attribute \"A\" that points to an attribute \"B\" will update the value of attribute \"B\".\r\n\r\n##[1.2.1] - 2019-09-09\r\n- Built against Look Up Table v0.1.0\r\n\r\n##[1.1.4] - 2019-09-05\r\n- Fixed a bug on Write Headers, an error will now be thrown if a bad GUID is passed in and the Linked List is not found\r\n- Fixed a bug on Write Name, an error will now be thrown if a bad GUID is passed in and the Linked List is not found\r\n\r\n##[1.1.3] - 2019-09-05\r\n- Fixed a bug on Move that was passing out the parent GUID instead of the moved items GUID\r\n- Fixed a bug on Add Linked List where the \"Replaced?\" flag output was hardcoded to False.\r\n\r\n##[1.1.2] - 2019-08-23\r\n- Refactored GUIDs so that they aren't GUID paths, now we are back to using GUIDs\r\n\r\n##[1.1.1] - 2019-08-23\r\n- Fixed an issue with copy and move where the Linked List definition was not being copied and/or moved with the Linked List\r\n\r\n##[1.1.0] - 2019-08-22\r\n- Refactored Linked Lists to use a GUID made up of a \"path\" of GUIDs built up from a Linked Lists ancestors GUIDs.  This is a big change but does not break backwards compatibility with other 1.x.x packages.\r\n\r\n##[1.0.9] - 2019-08-20\r\n- Fixed a bug with spaces in names of linked lists\r\n\r\n##[1.0.8] - 2019-08-20\r\n- Separated source from compiled code\r\n\r\n##[1.0.7] - 2019-08-19\r\n- Addresses [Issue #4](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-linked-lists/issues/4/formatting-of-spaces-when-saving-to-xml) - which is a bug that was reported in the Test Executive as [Issue #18](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-test-executive/issues/18/attribute-id-and-tag-name-mean-the-same).\r\n\r\n##[1.0.6] - 2019-08-01\r\n- Addresses [Issue #3](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-linked-lists/issues?status=new&status=open) - which is a bug that was reported in the Test Executive as [Issue #9](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-test-executive/issues/9/adding-a-subroutine-creates-an-empty).  There was still a bug in v1.0.5.  There was one more change that needed to be made, setting the Flatten Pointer and Include Private flags to true on the Read Attributes method within the Copy Linked List Attributes.vi.\r\n\r\n##[1.0.5] - 2019-08-01\r\n- Addresses [Issue #3](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-linked-lists/issues?status=new&status=open) - which is a bug that was reported in the Test Executive as [Issue #9](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-test-executive/issues/9/adding-a-subroutine-creates-an-empty).\r\n\r\n\r\n##[1.0.4] - 2019-08-01\r\n- Addresses [Issue #2](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-linked-lists/issues/2/prevent-the-build-tree-data-type-method) - which is a feature request to prevent the Build Tree Data Type method from showing the contents of a subroutine in the tree representing the linked list\r\n\r\n##[1.0.3] - 2019-07-30\r\n- Fixes an issue reported in the Test Executive (issue #5) where copying a test was not propagating the new GUID to the header, so when the test exec was saved to disk the copied element would hold the GUID of the item it was copied from.  It turns out that the bug was in the Linked List, and the root cause was that when a Linked List was copied the header object for the new linked list was not storing the new GUID.  This bug has been fixed and is covered by TestAPI_CopyLinkedList_HeaderGUID.vi\r\n\r\n##[1.0.2] - 2019-07-30\r\n- Fixes an issue reported in the Test Executive (issue #4) where copying a test was creating a blank attribute for that test.  It turns out that the bug was in the Linked List, and the root cause was that when a Linked List with a private attribute was copied the private attribute would copy over as an empty attribute.  This bug has been fixed and is covered by TestAPI_CopyLinkedList_PrivateAttributes.vi and TestAPI_CopyLinkedList_PublicAttributes.vi\r\n\r\n##[1.0.1] - 2019-07-24\r\n- Fixes a bug that was causing duplicates in the Attributes, Attribute Names, and Attribute IDs returned by the Get Child Attributes.vi of the Linked List class.  This was causing a problem with the Get List of Attributes by Type method of the by-ref class.\r\n\r\n## [1.0.0] - 2019-07-19\r\n- Initial Release\r\n- Fixes bug with Move Linked List method, attributes were being incorrectly copied to the destination parent on a move operation.\r\n\r\n## [0.0.38] - 2019-07-19\r\n- Last version before initial release",

This is a big change but does not break backwards compatibility with other 1.x.x packages.\r\n\r\n##[1.0.9] - 2019-08-20\r\n- Fixed a bug with spaces in names of linked lists\r\n\r\n##[1.0.8] - 2019-08-20\r\n- Separated source from compiled code\r\n\r\n##[1.0.7] - 2019-08-19\r\n- Addresses [Issue #4](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-linked-lists/issues/4/formatting-of-spaces-when-saving-to-xml) - which is a bug that was reported in the Test Executive as [Issue #18](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-test-executive/issues/18/attribute-id-and-tag-name-mean-the-same).\r\n\r\n##[1.0.6] - 2019-08-01\r\n- Addresses [Issue #3](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-linked-lists/issues?status=new&status=open) - which is a bug that was reported in the Test Executive as [Issue #9](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-test-executive/issues/9/adding-a-subroutine-creates-an-empty).  There was still a bug in v1.0.5.  There was one more change that needed to be made, setting the Flatten Pointer and Include Private flags to true on the Read Attributes method within the Copy Linked List Attributes.vi.\r\n\r\n##[1.0.5] - 2019-08-01\r\n- Addresses [Issue #3](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-linked-lists/issues?status=new&status=open) - which is a bug that was reported in the Test Executive as [Issue #9](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-test-executive/issues/9/adding-a-subroutine-creates-an-empty).\r\n\r\n\r\n##[1.0.4] - 2019-08-01\r\n- Addresses [Issue #2](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-linked-lists/issues/2/prevent-the-build-tree-data-type-method) - which is a feature request to prevent the Build Tree Data Type method from showing the contents of a subroutine in the tree representing the linked list\r\n\r\n##[1.0.3] - 2019-07-30\r\n- Fixes an issue reported in the Test Executive (issue #5) where copying a test was not propagating the new GUID to the header, so when the test exec was saved to disk the copied element would hold the GUID of the item it was copied from.  It turns out that the bug was in the Linked List, and the root cause was that when a Linked List was copied the header object for the new linked list was not storing the new GUID.  This bug has been fixed and is covered by TestAPI_CopyLinkedList_HeaderGUID.vi\r\n\r\n##[1.0.2] - 2019-07-30\r\n- Fixes an issue reported in the Test Executive (issue #4) where copying a test was creating a blank attribute for that test.  It turns out that the bug was in the Linked List, and the root cause was that when a Linked List with a private attribute was copied the private attribute would copy over as an empty attribute.  This bug has been fixed and is covered by TestAPI_CopyLinkedList_PrivateAttributes.vi and TestAPI_CopyLinkedList_PublicAttributes.vi\r\n\r\n##[1.0.1] - 2019-07-24\r\n- Fixes a bug that was causing duplicates in the Attributes, Attribute Names, and Attribute IDs returned by the Get Child Attributes.vi of the Linked List class.  This was causing a problem with the Get List of Attributes by Type method of the by-ref class.\r\n\r\n## [1.0.0] - 2019-07-19\r\n- Initial Release\r\n- Fixes bug with Move Linked List method, attributes were being incorrectly copied to the destination parent on a move operation.\r\n\r\n## [0.0.38] - 2019-07-19\r\n- Last version before initial release",

(*mva-framework* extends with concrete ViewManagers, concrete ListboxBusMonitor, IDialogBox, and dialog box implementations.)\r\n- MonitoredMediator decorates Mediator to allow monitoring. Use MonitoredMediator and inject a concrete bus monitor (e.g. ListboxBusMonitor) to monitor the data bus.\r\n- No public message API for showing bus monitor. (i.e. It is no longer the ViewModel's job to manage this.) Bus monitor constructor binds to published datum. ('Construct Listbox Bus Monitor.vi' establishes the binding.)\r\n- Viewable actors do not limit to launching one dialog box at a time (it is now the developer's option to enforce this rule if/when desired).\r\n\r\n### Added\r\n- Multiple bus monitors may be injected at application launch. (e.g. one that monitors data values and another that tracks publishers and subscriber counts.)\r\n- Bus monitors may now track number of subscribers to data (implementation in ListboxBusMonitor does not yet exist).\r\n\r\n## [2.2.3] - 2019-09-12\r\n### Fixed\r\n- Updated Transport dependency to fix returning unnecessary error when Observers request formatted strings with no format specifier\r\n\r\n## [2.2.2] - 2019-09-09\r\n### Fixed\r\n- Incorrect Transport version dependency (should be 0.0.3)\r\n\r\n## [2.2.1] - 2019-09-09\r\n### Fixed\r\n- Broken ancestry for all Notification Msg descendants (temporary deprecated ancestor to be removed in major version 3)\r\n\r\n## [2.2.0] - 2019-09-06 - DO NOT USE THIS RELEASE (see 2.2.1)\r\n### Changed\r\n- Default framework log state is *no logging*.

Therefore you will be very fast to organize your elements on the VI.\n\nUsage\n---------------------------------------------------\nAt first you have to select some elements either on the fronpanel or the blockdiagram of the VI.\nThe Quick Drop plug-in uses the default shortcut A.\n\nThere are three possible ways to act with the plug-in using the mouse or only the keyboard.\n\nUsing the mouse\nWith the mouse you can simply act with the plugin\n\nFirstly press CTRL+SPACE to open the quick drop dialog, then press CTRL+A to open the plug-in dialog containing the alignment and distribution buttons. The different buttons can be pressed to move the objects. At the end the dialog can be closed by clicking on the close button in the corner or by pressing the ESC key.\n\nUsing the keyboard\nA faster way to handle this Quick Drop plug-in is by using the keyboard.\n\nAfter selecting some elements press CTRL+SPACE and CTRL+A to open the dialog window.

(Only some of the distribution elements can be controlled by key.)\n\nUsing the Quick Drop combo box\nThe last option to handle the plugin is based on Darren's suggestions.\n\nAfter selecting some elements open the Quick Drop dialog by pressing CTRL+SPACE.

Then insert AQ into the combo box and press CTRL+A. This will align the elements to the left and distribute it with an equal vertical gap. I use this to arrange the VI input and output elements on the blockdiagram.\n\nNumeric controls on the frontpanel\n---------------------------------------------------\nLike the original plug-in the increment and decrement buttons of a numeric control will be hidden during alignment (based on [this idea exchange](https://forums.ni.com/t5/LabVIEW-Idea-Exchange/Align-objects-should-not-align-increment-decrement-buttons/idi-p/1050356?profile.language=en)).\n\nBy default this behavior is activated. It is possible to deactivate it in the LabVIEW.ini.\n\nQuick Drop Options\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nYou can control certain aspects of operation of this plug-in by setting the following LabVIEW.ini tokens:\n\nQDAlignElements.HideIncDec (Default: True):  Hide Inc/Dec buttons of Numeric Controls during alignment. \n",

          "Release Notes": "## [1.7.1] - 2020-03-18\r\n- Quick patch to update Test Exec Version in API\r\n\r\n## [1.7.0] - 2020-03-17\r\n- Built against Linked List 1.6.0\r\n- Added ability to Save As with new GUIDs for the new copy.\r\n\r\n## [1.6.2] - 2020-02-19\r\n- Fixed a bug in Case Structures that were causing them to exit when an executed conditional branch contained a subroutine.\r\n- Added an improvement to how subroutines are loaded into calling routines.  If a subroutines interface changes after being inserted into a calling routine, on the next load of that calling routine the interface updates will be loaded with the subroutine.\r\n\r\n## [1.6.1] - 2020-01-07\r\n- Mass compile.\r\n\r\n## [1.6.0] - 2020-01-06\r\n- Created a new flow control type called \"Case Structure\".  The \"Case Structure\" allows for stacked IF ELSE statements, meaning that the developer can run through a chain of assertions on different variable inputs until one passes, which will cause the Conditional Branch associated with that assertion/variable pairing to execute.  There is an always include input on the Insert Case Structure method that requires that an \"Else Conditional Branch\" must be passed in, the \"Else Conditional Branch\" will run if all assertions fail.  The main difference between the Case Structure and the Conditional Structure is that the Conditional only allows for one assertion to be evaluated while the Case Structure allows for an uncapped array of assertions to be evaluated.\r\n\r\n## [1.5.3] - 2019-12-04\r\n- Added a new method for retrieving active element index without needing to draw the tree\r\n\r\n## [1.5.2] - 2019-12-04\r\n- Updated the Draw Tree utility method of the Test Exec Ref class to pass out the active element index, this works regardless of if subroutine is executing or not\r\n\r\n## [1.5.1] - 2019-12-02\r\n- Added ability to remove multiple attributes at once\r\n\r\n## [1.5.0] - 2019-10-30\r\n- Refactored how conditionals treat X and Y variables.  They now need to either be passed in by value, or if passed in as a pointer they need to flagged as pointers\r\n\r\n## [1.4.12] - 2019-10-29\r\n- Built against Linked List v.1.5.9\r\n\r\n## [1.4.11] - 2019-10-29\r\n- Refactored how Test Executive Version is handled, it is now effectively hard coded and will need to be manually revisioned with each package build.\r\n\r\n## [1.4.10] - 2019-10-28\r\n- Added public API methods for reading and writing attribute meta data.\r\n\r\n## [1.4.9] - 2019-10-28\r\n- Updated Test Exec File Version to be a single integer (i.e. v1, v2...).\r\n\r\n## [1.4.8] - 2019-10-24\r\n- Added public API methods for reading and writing meta data.\r\n\r\n## [1.4.7] - 2019-10-24\r\n- Re-link and mass compile.\r\n\r\n## [1.4.6] - 2019-10-23\r\n- Built against linked list v1.5.5\r\n\r\n## [1.4.5] - 2019-10-23\r\n- Added more information to error message being generated by a failure to parse an attribute in the Unflatten method of the Executioner class\r\n\r\n## [1.4.4] - 2019-10-22\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.5.4\r\n\r\n## [1.4.3] - 2019-10-08\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.4.5\r\n\r\n## [1.4.2] - 2019-10-07\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.4.4\r\n\r\n## [1.4.1] - 2019-10-07\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.4.1\r\n\r\n## [1.4.0] - 2019-10-04\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.4.0\r\n- First release of parameterization, includes two new methods: Load Parameterized Test Executive and Create Parameterized Test Executive.\r\n\r\n## [1.3.1] - 2019-10-02\r\n- Building up the ability to parameterize test executives (work in progress)\r\n- Fixed a bug that was preventing parameterized attributes at the namespace level from propagating down into subroutines\r\n\r\n## [1.3.0] - 2019-09-13\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.2.2\r\n- Added public method for retrieving all attributes\r\n- Refactored subroutine attribute handling to allow passing values out of subroutines\r\n\r\n## [1.2.1] - 2019-09-13\r\n- No changes introduced in this build\r\n\r\n## [1.2.0] - 2019-09-13\r\n- Refactored Get Next to pass out an \"Active Test Executive\".

          "Release Notes": "## [1.6.2] - 2020-02-19\r\n- Fixed a bug in Case Structures that were causing them to exit when an executed conditional branch contained a subroutine.\r\n- Added an improvement to how subroutines are loaded into calling routines.  If a subroutines interface changes after being inserted into a calling routine, on the next load of that calling routine the interface updates will be loaded with the subroutine.\r\n\r\n## [1.6.1] - 2020-01-07\r\n- Mass compile.\r\n\r\n## [1.6.0] - 2020-01-06\r\n- Created a new flow control type called \"Case Structure\".  The \"Case Structure\" allows for stacked IF ELSE statements, meaning that the developer can run through a chain of assertions on different variable inputs until one passes, which will cause the Conditional Branch associated with that assertion/variable pairing to execute.  There is an always include input on the Insert Case Structure method that requires that an \"Else Conditional Branch\" must be passed in, the \"Else Conditional Branch\" will run if all assertions fail.  The main difference between the Case Structure and the Conditional Structure is that the Conditional only allows for one assertion to be evaluated while the Case Structure allows for an uncapped array of assertions to be evaluated.\r\n\r\n## [1.5.3] - 2019-12-04\r\n- Added a new method for retrieving active element index without needing to draw the tree\r\n\r\n## [1.5.2] - 2019-12-04\r\n- Updated the Draw Tree utility method of the Test Exec Ref class to pass out the active element index, this works regardless of if subroutine is executing or not\r\n\r\n## [1.5.1] - 2019-12-02\r\n- Added ability to remove multiple attributes at once\r\n\r\n## [1.5.0] - 2019-10-30\r\n- Refactored how conditionals treat X and Y variables.  They now need to either be passed in by value, or if passed in as a pointer they need to flagged as pointers\r\n\r\n## [1.4.12] - 2019-10-29\r\n- Built against Linked List v.1.5.9\r\n\r\n## [1.4.11] - 2019-10-29\r\n- Refactored how Test Executive Version is handled, it is now effectively hard coded and will need to be manually revisioned with each package build.\r\n\r\n## [1.4.10] - 2019-10-28\r\n- Added public API methods for reading and writing attribute meta data.\r\n\r\n## [1.4.9] - 2019-10-28\r\n- Updated Test Exec File Version to be a single integer (i.e. v1, v2...).\r\n\r\n## [1.4.8] - 2019-10-24\r\n- Added public API methods for reading and writing meta data.\r\n\r\n## [1.4.7] - 2019-10-24\r\n- Re-link and mass compile.\r\n\r\n## [1.4.6] - 2019-10-23\r\n- Built against linked list v1.5.5\r\n\r\n## [1.4.5] - 2019-10-23\r\n- Added more information to error message being generated by a failure to parse an attribute in the Unflatten method of the Executioner class\r\n\r\n## [1.4.4] - 2019-10-22\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.5.4\r\n\r\n## [1.4.3] - 2019-10-08\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.4.5\r\n\r\n## [1.4.2] - 2019-10-07\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.4.4\r\n\r\n## [1.4.1] - 2019-10-07\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.4.1\r\n\r\n## [1.4.0] - 2019-10-04\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.4.0\r\n- First release of parameterization, includes two new methods: Load Parameterized Test Executive and Create Parameterized Test Executive.\r\n\r\n## [1.3.1] - 2019-10-02\r\n- Building up the ability to parameterize test executives (work in progress)\r\n- Fixed a bug that was preventing parameterized attributes at the namespace level from propagating down into subroutines\r\n\r\n## [1.3.0] - 2019-09-13\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.2.2\r\n- Added public method for retrieving all attributes\r\n- Refactored subroutine attribute handling to allow passing values out of subroutines\r\n\r\n## [1.2.1] - 2019-09-13\r\n- No changes introduced in this build\r\n\r\n## [1.2.0] - 2019-09-13\r\n- Refactored Get Next to pass out an \"Active Test Executive\".

          "Release Notes": "## [1.9.2] - 2020-05-04\r\n- Fixed a linking issue against the old persistence type in the paramterization methods.\r\n\r\n## [1.9.1] - 2020-05-04\r\n- Fixed a linking issue against the old persistence type in the paramterization methods.\r\n\r\n## [1.9.0] - 2020-05-04\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.7.0, which includes a new dependency on a persistence G Package (it used to be bundled up inside the Linked List package but I pulled it out).  This new Persistence package depends on a new Data Type Serialization package, which enables the consumer to use a custom type system with CAML persistence.\r\n\r\n## [1.8.2] - 2020-04-06\r\n- Refactored how the flow control classes set their execution status flags in their Get Next Override.  This was done to fix a bug where calling Halt inside a loop would stop the loop but not Halt the name space (The loop types were treating Halt just like the Stop Loop flow control type).\r\n\r\n## [1.8.1] - 2020-04-01\r\n- Fixed a bug in Insert Subroutine.  The \"Read From Text File\" call had \"Convert EOL\" set, which interfered with the binary string formatting for attributes.  When we make the move to Test Exec v2.x.x I will separate the concern of reading from and writing to file from the test executive all together.\r\n\r\n## [1.8.0] - 2020-03-19\r\n- Added new flow control type, \"Halt\".  Calling a \"Halt\" will cause the active namespace to stop executing.  This means that if a Halt is executed in a running subroutine, the subroutine will stop and the calling routine will continue.  If a Halt is called in a top level routine, the test executive will stop executing.\r\n\r\n## [1.7.1] - 2020-03-18\r\n- Quick patch to update Test Exec Version in API\r\n\r\n## [1.7.0] - 2020-03-17\r\n- Built against Linked List 1.6.0\r\n- Added ability to Save As with new GUIDs for the new copy.\r\n\r\n## [1.6.2] - 2020-02-19\r\n- Fixed a bug in Case Structures that were causing them to exit when an executed conditional branch contained a subroutine.\r\n- Added an improvement to how subroutines are loaded into calling routines.  If a subroutines interface changes after being inserted into a calling routine, on the next load of that calling routine the interface updates will be loaded with the subroutine.\r\n\r\n## [1.6.1] - 2020-01-07\r\n- Mass compile.\r\n\r\n## [1.6.0] - 2020-01-06\r\n- Created a new flow control type called \"Case Structure\".  The \"Case Structure\" allows for stacked IF ELSE statements, meaning that the developer can run through a chain of assertions on different variable inputs until one passes, which will cause the Conditional Branch associated with that assertion/variable pairing to execute.  There is an always include input on the Insert Case Structure method that requires that an \"Else Conditional Branch\" must be passed in, the \"Else Conditional Branch\" will run if all assertions fail.  The main difference between the Case Structure and the Conditional Structure is that the Conditional only allows for one assertion to be evaluated while the Case Structure allows for an uncapped array of assertions to be evaluated.\r\n\r\n## [1.5.3] - 2019-12-04\r\n- Added a new method for retrieving active element index without needing to draw the tree\r\n\r\n## [1.5.2] - 2019-12-04\r\n- Updated the Draw Tree utility method of the Test Exec Ref class to pass out the active element index, this works regardless of if subroutine is executing or not\r\n\r\n## [1.5.1] - 2019-12-02\r\n- Added ability to remove multiple attributes at once\r\n\r\n## [1.5.0] - 2019-10-30\r\n- Refactored how conditionals treat X and Y variables.  They now need to either be passed in by value, or if passed in as a pointer they need to flagged as pointers\r\n\r\n## [1.4.12] - 2019-10-29\r\n- Built against Linked List v.1.5.9\r\n\r\n## [1.4.11] - 2019-10-29\r\n- Refactored how Test Executive Version is handled, it is now effectively hard coded and will need to be manually revisioned with each package build.\r\n\r\n## [1.4.10] - 2019-10-28\r\n- Added public API methods for reading and writing attribute meta data.\r\n\r\n## [1.4.9] - 2019-10-28\r\n- Updated Test Exec File Version to be a single integer (i.e. v1, v2...).\r\n\r\n## [1.4.8] - 2019-10-24\r\n- Added public API methods for reading and writing meta data.\r\n\r\n## [1.4.7] - 2019-10-24\r\n- Re-link and mass compile.\r\n\r\n## [1.4.6] - 2019-10-23\r\n- Built against linked list v1.5.5\r\n\r\n## [1.4.5] - 2019-10-23\r\n- Added more information to error message being generated by a failure to parse an attribute in the Unflatten method of the Executioner class\r\n\r\n## [1.4.4] - 2019-10-22\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.5.4\r\n\r\n## [1.4.3] - 2019-10-08\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.4.5\r\n\r\n## [1.4.2] - 2019-10-07\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.4.4\r\n\r\n## [1.4.1] - 2019-10-07\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.4.1\r\n\r\n## [1.4.0] - 2019-10-04\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.4.0\r\n- First release of parameterization, includes two new methods: Load Parameterized Test Executive and Create Parameterized Test Executive.\r\n\r\n## [1.3.1] - 2019-10-02\r\n- Building up the ability to parameterize test executives (work in progress)\r\n- Fixed a bug that was preventing parameterized attributes at the namespace level from propagating down into subroutines\r\n\r\n## [1.3.0] - 2019-09-13\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.2.2\r\n- Added public method for retrieving all attributes\r\n- Refactored subroutine attribute handling to allow passing values out of subroutines\r\n\r\n## [1.2.1] - 2019-09-13\r\n- No changes introduced in this build\r\n\r\n## [1.2.0] - 2019-09-13\r\n- Refactored Get Next to pass out an \"Active Test Executive\".  The primary use case for this is subroutines as it allows teststeps to gain access to subroutine data space\r\n- Fixed a bug that was preventing Subroutine (flow control element) from properly gaining the public attributes of the Subroutine (from disk) that it loads and executes\r\n\r\n## [1.1.0] - 2019-09-09\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.2.1\r\n- Refactored Insert Test to pass out a scaler \"Replaced?\" flag instead of a 1D array\r\n\r\n## [1.0.1] - 2019-09-09\r\n- Updated \"Insert\" methods to include a \"replaced?\" flag as an output to notify user that the insert replaced an existing item\r\n\r\n## [1.0.0] - 2019-09-05\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.1.4\r\n- This is a major revision of the Test Executive, it is not backwards compatible with the 0.x.x-Beta versions\r\n- Updated connector panes on public by reference methods to include required inputs where appropriate\r\n- Added file version tracking for saved tests\r\n- Added checksum verification for subroutines\r\n- Added test executive version tracking for saved tests\r\n\r\n## [0.0.47] - 2019-8-26\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.1.2\r\n- Refactored how subroutines are executed.  Subroutines are now given their own execution thread\r\n\r\n## [0.0.46] - 2019-8-20\r\n- Fixed an issue with the Stop Loop executioner not propagating out of a conditional up to a containing loop\r\n- Added a sandbox VI demonstrating stopping a loop with attributes and a conditional structure\r\n\r\n## [0.0.45] - 2019-8-20\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.0.9\r\n\r\n## [0.0.44] - 2019-8-20\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.0.8\r\n\r\n## [0.0.43] - 2019-8-19\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.0.7, which addresses Linked List [issue #4](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-linked-lists/issues/4/formatting-of-spaces-when-saving-to-xml), which fixes Test Executive [issue #21](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-test-executive/issues/21/executioner-name-is-different-as-a-result). \r\n- This build addresses Test Executive [issue #19](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-test-executive/issues/19/create-test-from-object-can-take-in-any)\r\n- This build addresses Test Executive [issue #23](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-test-executive/issues/23/test-testexecution_for)\r\n- This build addresses Test Executive [issue #20](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-test-executive/issues/20/estapi_replace-executionervi-failure)\r\n\r\n## [0.0.42] - 2019-8-01\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.0.6, which addresses Linked List [issue #3](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-linked-lists/issues/3/build-tree-data-type-is-not-working-with) - Build Tree Data Type is not working with Private Attributes.

This was done to fix a bug where calling Halt inside a loop would stop the loop but not Halt the name space (The loop types were treating Halt just like the Stop Loop flow control type).\r\n\r\n## [1.8.1] - 2020-04-01\r\n- Fixed a bug in Insert Subroutine.  The \"Read From Text File\" call had \"Convert EOL\" set, which interfered with the binary string formatting for attributes.  When we make the move to Test Exec v2.x.x I will separate the concern of reading from and writing to file from the test executive all together.\r\n\r\n## [1.8.0] - 2020-03-19\r\n- Added new flow control type, \"Halt\".  Calling a \"Halt\" will cause the active namespace to stop executing.  This means that if a Halt is executed in a running subroutine, the subroutine will stop and the calling routine will continue.  If a Halt is called in a top level routine, the test executive will stop executing.\r\n\r\n## [1.7.1] - 2020-03-18\r\n- Quick patch to update Test Exec Version in API\r\n\r\n## [1.7.0] - 2020-03-17\r\n- Built against Linked List 1.6.0\r\n- Added ability to Save As with new GUIDs for the new copy.\r\n\r\n## [1.6.2] - 2020-02-19\r\n- Fixed a bug in Case Structures that were causing them to exit when an executed conditional branch contained a subroutine.\r\n- Added an improvement to how subroutines are loaded into calling routines.  If a subroutines interface changes after being inserted into a calling routine, on the next load of that calling routine the interface updates will be loaded with the subroutine.\r\n\r\n## [1.6.1] - 2020-01-07\r\n- Mass compile.\r\n\r\n## [1.6.0] - 2020-01-06\r\n- Created a new flow control type called \"Case Structure\".  The \"Case Structure\" allows for stacked IF ELSE statements, meaning that the developer can run through a chain of assertions on different variable inputs until one passes, which will cause the Conditional Branch associated with that assertion/variable pairing to execute.  There is an always include input on the Insert Case Structure method that requires that an \"Else Conditional Branch\" must be passed in, the \"Else Conditional Branch\" will run if all assertions fail.  The main difference between the Case Structure and the Conditional Structure is that the Conditional only allows for one assertion to be evaluated while the Case Structure allows for an uncapped array of assertions to be evaluated.\r\n\r\n## [1.5.3] - 2019-12-04\r\n- Added a new method for retrieving active element index without needing to draw the tree\r\n\r\n## [1.5.2] - 2019-12-04\r\n- Updated the Draw Tree utility method of the Test Exec Ref class to pass out the active element index, this works regardless of if subroutine is executing or not\r\n\r\n## [1.5.1] - 2019-12-02\r\n- Added ability to remove multiple attributes at once\r\n\r\n## [1.5.0] - 2019-10-30\r\n- Refactored how conditionals treat X and Y variables.  They now need to either be passed in by value, or if passed in as a pointer they need to flagged as pointers\r\n\r\n## [1.4.12] - 2019-10-29\r\n- Built against Linked List v.1.5.9\r\n\r\n## [1.4.11] - 2019-10-29\r\n- Refactored how Test Executive Version is handled, it is now effectively hard coded and will need to be manually revisioned with each package build.\r\n\r\n## [1.4.10] - 2019-10-28\r\n- Added public API methods for reading and writing attribute meta data.\r\n\r\n## [1.4.9] - 2019-10-28\r\n- Updated Test Exec File Version to be a single integer (i.e. v1, v2...).\r\n\r\n## [1.4.8] - 2019-10-24\r\n- Added public API methods for reading and writing meta data.\r\n\r\n## [1.4.7] - 2019-10-24\r\n- Re-link and mass compile.\r\n\r\n## [1.4.6] - 2019-10-23\r\n- Built against linked list v1.5.5\r\n\r\n## [1.4.5] - 2019-10-23\r\n- Added more information to error message being generated by a failure to parse an attribute in the Unflatten method of the Executioner class\r\n\r\n## [1.4.4] - 2019-10-22\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.5.4\r\n\r\n## [1.4.3] - 2019-10-08\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.4.5\r\n\r\n## [1.4.2] - 2019-10-07\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.4.4\r\n\r\n## [1.4.1] - 2019-10-07\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.4.1\r\n\r\n## [1.4.0] - 2019-10-04\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.4.0\r\n- First release of parameterization, includes two new methods: Load Parameterized Test Executive and Create Parameterized Test Executive.\r\n\r\n## [1.3.1] - 2019-10-02\r\n- Building up the ability to parameterize test executives (work in progress)\r\n- Fixed a bug that was preventing parameterized attributes at the namespace level from propagating down into subroutines\r\n\r\n## [1.3.0] - 2019-09-13\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.2.2\r\n- Added public method for retrieving all attributes\r\n- Refactored subroutine attribute handling to allow passing values out of subroutines\r\n\r\n## [1.2.1] - 2019-09-13\r\n- No changes introduced in this build\r\n\r\n## [1.2.0] - 2019-09-13\r\n- Refactored Get Next to pass out an \"Active Test Executive\".  The primary use case for this is subroutines as it allows teststeps to gain access to subroutine data space\r\n- Fixed a bug that was preventing Subroutine (flow control element) from properly gaining the public attributes of the Subroutine (from disk) that it loads and executes\r\n\r\n## [1.1.0] - 2019-09-09\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.2.1\r\n- Refactored Insert Test to pass out a scaler \"Replaced?\" flag instead of a 1D array\r\n\r\n## [1.0.1] - 2019-09-09\r\n- Updated \"Insert\" methods to include a \"replaced?\" flag as an output to notify user that the insert replaced an existing item\r\n\r\n## [1.0.0] - 2019-09-05\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.1.4\r\n- This is a major revision of the Test Executive, it is not backwards compatible with the 0.x.x-Beta versions\r\n- Updated connector panes on public by reference methods to include required inputs where appropriate\r\n- Added file version tracking for saved tests\r\n- Added checksum verification for subroutines\r\n- Added test executive version tracking for saved tests\r\n\r\n## [0.0.47] - 2019-8-26\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.1.2\r\n- Refactored how subroutines are executed.  Subroutines are now given their own execution thread\r\n\r\n## [0.0.46] - 2019-8-20\r\n- Fixed an issue with the Stop Loop executioner not propagating out of a conditional up to a containing loop\r\n- Added a sandbox VI demonstrating stopping a loop with attributes and a conditional structure\r\n\r\n## [0.0.45] - 2019-8-20\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.0.9\r\n\r\n## [0.0.44] - 2019-8-20\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.0.8\r\n\r\n## [0.0.43] - 2019-8-19\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.0.7, which addresses Linked List [issue #4](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-linked-lists/issues/4/formatting-of-spaces-when-saving-to-xml), which fixes Test Executive [issue #21](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-test-executive/issues/21/executioner-name-is-different-as-a-result). \r\n- This build addresses Test Executive [issue #19](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-test-executive/issues/19/create-test-from-object-can-take-in-any)\r\n- This build addresses Test Executive [issue #23](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-test-executive/issues/23/test-testexecution_for)\r\n- This build addresses Test Executive [issue #20](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-test-executive/issues/20/estapi_replace-executionervi-failure)\r\n\r\n## [0.0.42] - 2019-8-01\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.0.6, which addresses Linked List [issue #3](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-linked-lists/issues/3/build-tree-data-type-is-not-working-with) - Build Tree Data Type is not working with Private Attributes.

The \"Case Structure\" allows for stacked IF ELSE statements, meaning that the developer can run through a chain of assertions on different variable inputs until one passes, which will cause the Conditional Branch associated with that assertion/variable pairing to execute.  There is an always include input on the Insert Case Structure method that requires that an \"Else Conditional Branch\" must be passed in, the \"Else Conditional Branch\" will run if all assertions fail.  The main difference between the Case Structure and the Conditional Structure is that the Conditional only allows for one assertion to be evaluated while the Case Structure allows for an uncapped array of assertions to be evaluated.\r\n\r\n## [1.5.3] - 2019-12-04\r\n- Added a new method for retrieving active element index without needing to draw the tree\r\n\r\n## [1.5.2] - 2019-12-04\r\n- Updated the Draw Tree utility method of the Test Exec Ref class to pass out the active element index, this works regardless of if subroutine is executing or not\r\n\r\n## [1.5.1] - 2019-12-02\r\n- Added ability to remove multiple attributes at once\r\n\r\n## [1.5.0] - 2019-10-30\r\n- Refactored how conditionals treat X and Y variables.

          "Release Notes": "## [1.6.0] - 2020-01-06\r\n- Created a new flow control type called \"Case Structure\".  The \"Case Structure\" allows for stacked IF ELSE statements, meaning that the developer can run through a chain of assertions on different variable inputs until one passes, which will cause the Conditional Branch associated with that assertion/variable pairing to execute.  There is an always include input on the Insert Case Structure method that requires that an \"Else Conditional Branch\" must be passed in, the \"Else Conditional Branch\" will run if all assertions fail.  The main difference between the Case Structure and the Conditional Structure is that the Conditional only allows for one assertion to be evaluated while the Case Structure allows for an uncapped array of assertions to be evaluated.\r\n\r\n## [1.5.3] - 2019-12-04\r\n- Added a new method for retrieving active element index without needing to draw the tree\r\n\r\n## [1.5.2] - 2019-12-04\r\n- Updated the Draw Tree utility method of the Test Exec Ref class to pass out the active element index, this works regardless of if subroutine is executing or not\r\n\r\n## [1.5.1] - 2019-12-02\r\n- Added ability to remove multiple attributes at once\r\n\r\n## [1.5.0] - 2019-10-30\r\n- Refactored how conditionals treat X and Y variables.  They now need to either be passed in by value, or if passed in as a pointer they need to flagged as pointers\r\n\r\n## [1.4.12] - 2019-10-29\r\n- Built against Linked List v.1.5.9\r\n\r\n## [1.4.11] - 2019-10-29\r\n- Refactored how Test Executive Version is handled, it is now effectively hard coded and will need to be manually revisioned with each package build.\r\n\r\n## [1.4.10] - 2019-10-28\r\n- Added public API methods for reading and writing attribute meta data.\r\n\r\n## [1.4.9] - 2019-10-28\r\n- Updated Test Exec File Version to be a single integer (i.e. v1, v2...).\r\n\r\n## [1.4.8] - 2019-10-24\r\n- Added public API methods for reading and writing meta data.\r\n\r\n## [1.4.7] - 2019-10-24\r\n- Re-link and mass compile.\r\n\r\n## [1.4.6] - 2019-10-23\r\n- Built against linked list v1.5.5\r\n\r\n## [1.4.5] - 2019-10-23\r\n- Added more information to error message being generated by a failure to parse an attribute in the Unflatten method of the Executioner class\r\n\r\n## [1.4.4] - 2019-10-22\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.5.4\r\n\r\n## [1.4.3] - 2019-10-08\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.4.5\r\n\r\n## [1.4.2] - 2019-10-07\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.4.4\r\n\r\n## [1.4.1] - 2019-10-07\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.4.1\r\n\r\n## [1.4.0] - 2019-10-04\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.4.0\r\n- First release of parameterization, includes two new methods: Load Parameterized Test Executive and Create Parameterized Test Executive.\r\n\r\n## [1.3.1] - 2019-10-02\r\n- Building up the ability to parameterize test executives (work in progress)\r\n- Fixed a bug that was preventing parameterized attributes at the namespace level from propagating down into subroutines\r\n\r\n## [1.3.0] - 2019-09-13\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.2.2\r\n- Added public method for retrieving all attributes\r\n- Refactored subroutine attribute handling to allow passing values out of subroutines\r\n\r\n## [1.2.1] - 2019-09-13\r\n- No changes introduced in this build\r\n\r\n## [1.2.0] - 2019-09-13\r\n- Refactored Get Next to pass out an \"Active Test Executive\".  The primary use case for this is subroutines as it allows teststeps to gain access to subroutine data space\r\n- Fixed a bug that was preventing Subroutine (flow control element) from properly gaining the public attributes of the Subroutine (from disk) that it loads and executes\r\n\r\n## [1.1.0] - 2019-09-09\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.2.1\r\n- Refactored Insert Test to pass out a scaler \"Replaced?\" flag instead of a 1D array\r\n\r\n## [1.0.1] - 2019-09-09\r\n- Updated \"Insert\" methods to include a \"replaced?\" flag as an output to notify user that the insert replaced an existing item\r\n\r\n## [1.0.0] - 2019-09-05\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.1.4\r\n- This is a major revision of the Test Executive, it is not backwards compatible with the 0.x.x-Beta versions\r\n- Updated connector panes on public by reference methods to include required inputs where appropriate\r\n- Added file version tracking for saved tests\r\n- Added checksum verification for subroutines\r\n- Added test executive version tracking for saved tests\r\n\r\n## [0.0.47] - 2019-8-26\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.1.2\r\n- Refactored how subroutines are executed.

          "Release Notes": "## [1.10.2] - 2020-08-10\r\n- Moving away form GPM\r\n\r\n## [1.10.1] - 2020-06-23\r\n- GPM is killing me\r\n\r\n## [1.10.0] - 2020-06-23\r\n- Adding Parallel flow control type.\r\n\r\n## [1.9.6] - 2020-05-12\r\n- Depends on Linked List v1.7.5.\r\n\r\n## [1.9.5] - 2020-05-11\r\n- Depends on Linked List v1.7.4.\r\n\r\n## [1.9.4] - 2020-05-05\r\n- Depends on Linked List v1.7.1.\r\n\r\n## [1.9.3] - 2020-05-04\r\n- Added a new method for relinking top level routines to subroutines.\r\n\r\n## [1.9.2] - 2020-05-04\r\n- Fixed a linking issue against the old persistence type in the paramterization methods.\r\n\r\n## [1.9.1] - 2020-05-04\r\n- Fixed a linking issue against the old persistence type in the paramterization methods.\r\n\r\n## [1.9.0] - 2020-05-04\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.7.0, which includes a new dependency on a persistence G Package (it used to be bundled up inside the Linked List package but I pulled it out).  This new Persistence package depends on a new Data Type Serialization package, which enables the consumer to use a custom type system with CAML persistence.\r\n\r\n## [1.8.2] - 2020-04-06\r\n- Refactored how the flow control classes set their execution status flags in their Get Next Override.  This was done to fix a bug where calling Halt inside a loop would stop the loop but not Halt the name space (The loop types were treating Halt just like the Stop Loop flow control type).\r\n\r\n## [1.8.1] - 2020-04-01\r\n- Fixed a bug in Insert Subroutine.  The \"Read From Text File\" call had \"Convert EOL\" set, which interfered with the binary string formatting for attributes.  When we make the move to Test Exec v2.x.x I will separate the concern of reading from and writing to file from the test executive all together.\r\n\r\n## [1.8.0] - 2020-03-19\r\n- Added new flow control type, \"Halt\".  Calling a \"Halt\" will cause the active namespace to stop executing.  This means that if a Halt is executed in a running subroutine, the subroutine will stop and the calling routine will continue.  If a Halt is called in a top level routine, the test executive will stop executing.\r\n\r\n## [1.7.1] - 2020-03-18\r\n- Quick patch to update Test Exec Version in API\r\n\r\n## [1.7.0] - 2020-03-17\r\n- Built against Linked List 1.6.0\r\n- Added ability to Save As with new GUIDs for the new copy.\r\n\r\n## [1.6.2] - 2020-02-19\r\n- Fixed a bug in Case Structures that were causing them to exit when an executed conditional branch contained a subroutine.\r\n- Added an improvement to how subroutines are loaded into calling routines.  If a subroutines interface changes after being inserted into a calling routine, on the next load of that calling routine the interface updates will be loaded with the subroutine.\r\n\r\n## [1.6.1] - 2020-01-07\r\n- Mass compile.\r\n\r\n## [1.6.0] - 2020-01-06\r\n- Created a new flow control type called \"Case Structure\".  The \"Case Structure\" allows for stacked IF ELSE statements, meaning that the developer can run through a chain of assertions on different variable inputs until one passes, which will cause the Conditional Branch associated with that assertion/variable pairing to execute.  There is an always include input on the Insert Case Structure method that requires that an \"Else Conditional Branch\" must be passed in, the \"Else Conditional Branch\" will run if all assertions fail.  The main difference between the Case Structure and the Conditional Structure is that the Conditional only allows for one assertion to be evaluated while the Case Structure allows for an uncapped array of assertions to be evaluated.\r\n\r\n## [1.5.3] - 2019-12-04\r\n- Added a new method for retrieving active element index without needing to draw the tree\r\n\r\n## [1.5.2] - 2019-12-04\r\n- Updated the Draw Tree utility method of the Test Exec Ref class to pass out the active element index, this works regardless of if subroutine is executing or not\r\n\r\n## [1.5.1] - 2019-12-02\r\n- Added ability to remove multiple attributes at once\r\n\r\n## [1.5.0] - 2019-10-30\r\n- Refactored how conditionals treat X and Y variables.  They now need to either be passed in by value, or if passed in as a pointer they need to flagged as pointers\r\n\r\n## [1.4.12] - 2019-10-29\r\n- Built against Linked List v.1.5.9\r\n\r\n## [1.4.11] - 2019-10-29\r\n- Refactored how Test Executive Version is handled, it is now effectively hard coded and will need to be manually revisioned with each package build.\r\n\r\n## [1.4.10] - 2019-10-28\r\n- Added public API methods for reading and writing attribute meta data.\r\n\r\n## [1.4.9] - 2019-10-28\r\n- Updated Test Exec File Version to be a single integer (i.e. v1, v2...).\r\n\r\n## [1.4.8] - 2019-10-24\r\n- Added public API methods for reading and writing meta data.\r\n\r\n## [1.4.7] - 2019-10-24\r\n- Re-link and mass compile.\r\n\r\n## [1.4.6] - 2019-10-23\r\n- Built against linked list v1.5.5\r\n\r\n## [1.4.5] - 2019-10-23\r\n- Added more information to error message being generated by a failure to parse an attribute in the Unflatten method of the Executioner class\r\n\r\n## [1.4.4] - 2019-10-22\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.5.4\r\n\r\n## [1.4.3] - 2019-10-08\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.4.5\r\n\r\n## [1.4.2] - 2019-10-07\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.4.4\r\n\r\n## [1.4.1] - 2019-10-07\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.4.1\r\n\r\n## [1.4.0] - 2019-10-04\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.4.0\r\n- First release of parameterization, includes two new methods: Load Parameterized Test Executive and Create Parameterized Test Executive.\r\n\r\n## [1.3.1] - 2019-10-02\r\n- Building up the ability to parameterize test executives (work in progress)\r\n- Fixed a bug that was preventing parameterized attributes at the namespace level from propagating down into subroutines\r\n\r\n## [1.3.0] - 2019-09-13\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.2.2\r\n- Added public method for retrieving all attributes\r\n- Refactored subroutine attribute handling to allow passing values out of subroutines\r\n\r\n## [1.2.1] - 2019-09-13\r\n- No changes introduced in this build\r\n\r\n## [1.2.0] - 2019-09-13\r\n- Refactored Get Next to pass out an \"Active Test Executive\".  The primary use case for this is subroutines as it allows teststeps to gain access to subroutine data space\r\n- Fixed a bug that was preventing Subroutine (flow control element) from properly gaining the public attributes of the Subroutine (from disk) that it loads and executes\r\n\r\n## [1.1.0] - 2019-09-09\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.2.1\r\n- Refactored Insert Test to pass out a scaler \"Replaced?\" flag instead of a 1D array\r\n\r\n## [1.0.1] - 2019-09-09\r\n- Updated \"Insert\" methods to include a \"replaced?\" flag as an output to notify user that the insert replaced an existing item\r\n\r\n## [1.0.0] - 2019-09-05\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.1.4\r\n- This is a major revision of the Test Executive, it is not backwards compatible with the 0.x.x-Beta versions\r\n- Updated connector panes on public by reference methods to include required inputs where appropriate\r\n- Added file version tracking for saved tests\r\n- Added checksum verification for subroutines\r\n- Added test executive version tracking for saved tests\r\n\r\n## [0.0.47] - 2019-8-26\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.1.2\r\n- Refactored how subroutines are executed.  Subroutines are now given their own execution thread\r\n\r\n## [0.0.46] - 2019-8-20\r\n- Fixed an issue with the Stop Loop executioner not propagating out of a conditional up to a containing loop\r\n- Added a sandbox VI demonstrating stopping a loop with attributes and a conditional structure\r\n\r\n## [0.0.45] - 2019-8-20\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.0.9\r\n\r\n## [0.0.44] - 2019-8-20\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.0.8\r\n\r\n## [0.0.43] - 2019-8-19\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.0.7, which addresses Linked List [issue #4](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-linked-lists/issues/4/formatting-of-spaces-when-saving-to-xml), which fixes Test Executive [issue #21](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-test-executive/issues/21/executioner-name-is-different-as-a-result). \r\n- This build addresses Test Executive [issue #19](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-test-executive/issues/19/create-test-from-object-can-take-in-any)\r\n- This build addresses Test Executive [issue #23](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-test-executive/issues/23/test-testexecution_for)\r\n- This build addresses Test Executive [issue #20](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-test-executive/issues/20/estapi_replace-executionervi-failure)\r\n\r\n## [0.0.42] - 2019-8-01\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.0.6, which addresses Linked List [issue #3](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-linked-lists/issues/3/build-tree-data-type-is-not-working-with) - Build Tree Data Type is not working with Private Attributes.

          "Release Notes": "## [1.10.1] - 2020-06-23\r\n- GPM is killing me\r\n\r\n## [1.10.0] - 2020-06-23\r\n- Adding Parallel flow control type.\r\n\r\n## [1.9.6] - 2020-05-12\r\n- Depends on Linked List v1.7.5.\r\n\r\n## [1.9.5] - 2020-05-11\r\n- Depends on Linked List v1.7.4.\r\n\r\n## [1.9.4] - 2020-05-05\r\n- Depends on Linked List v1.7.1.\r\n\r\n## [1.9.3] - 2020-05-04\r\n- Added a new method for relinking top level routines to subroutines.\r\n\r\n## [1.9.2] - 2020-05-04\r\n- Fixed a linking issue against the old persistence type in the paramterization methods.\r\n\r\n## [1.9.1] - 2020-05-04\r\n- Fixed a linking issue against the old persistence type in the paramterization methods.\r\n\r\n## [1.9.0] - 2020-05-04\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.7.0, which includes a new dependency on a persistence G Package (it used to be bundled up inside the Linked List package but I pulled it out).  This new Persistence package depends on a new Data Type Serialization package, which enables the consumer to use a custom type system with CAML persistence.\r\n\r\n## [1.8.2] - 2020-04-06\r\n- Refactored how the flow control classes set their execution status flags in their Get Next Override.  This was done to fix a bug where calling Halt inside a loop would stop the loop but not Halt the name space (The loop types were treating Halt just like the Stop Loop flow control type).\r\n\r\n## [1.8.1] - 2020-04-01\r\n- Fixed a bug in Insert Subroutine.  The \"Read From Text File\" call had \"Convert EOL\" set, which interfered with the binary string formatting for attributes.  When we make the move to Test Exec v2.x.x I will separate the concern of reading from and writing to file from the test executive all together.\r\n\r\n## [1.8.0] - 2020-03-19\r\n- Added new flow control type, \"Halt\".  Calling a \"Halt\" will cause the active namespace to stop executing.  This means that if a Halt is executed in a running subroutine, the subroutine will stop and the calling routine will continue.  If a Halt is called in a top level routine, the test executive will stop executing.\r\n\r\n## [1.7.1] - 2020-03-18\r\n- Quick patch to update Test Exec Version in API\r\n\r\n## [1.7.0] - 2020-03-17\r\n- Built against Linked List 1.6.0\r\n- Added ability to Save As with new GUIDs for the new copy.\r\n\r\n## [1.6.2] - 2020-02-19\r\n- Fixed a bug in Case Structures that were causing them to exit when an executed conditional branch contained a subroutine.\r\n- Added an improvement to how subroutines are loaded into calling routines.  If a subroutines interface changes after being inserted into a calling routine, on the next load of that calling routine the interface updates will be loaded with the subroutine.\r\n\r\n## [1.6.1] - 2020-01-07\r\n- Mass compile.\r\n\r\n## [1.6.0] - 2020-01-06\r\n- Created a new flow control type called \"Case Structure\".  The \"Case Structure\" allows for stacked IF ELSE statements, meaning that the developer can run through a chain of assertions on different variable inputs until one passes, which will cause the Conditional Branch associated with that assertion/variable pairing to execute.  There is an always include input on the Insert Case Structure method that requires that an \"Else Conditional Branch\" must be passed in, the \"Else Conditional Branch\" will run if all assertions fail.  The main difference between the Case Structure and the Conditional Structure is that the Conditional only allows for one assertion to be evaluated while the Case Structure allows for an uncapped array of assertions to be evaluated.\r\n\r\n## [1.5.3] - 2019-12-04\r\n- Added a new method for retrieving active element index without needing to draw the tree\r\n\r\n## [1.5.2] - 2019-12-04\r\n- Updated the Draw Tree utility method of the Test Exec Ref class to pass out the active element index, this works regardless of if subroutine is executing or not\r\n\r\n## [1.5.1] - 2019-12-02\r\n- Added ability to remove multiple attributes at once\r\n\r\n## [1.5.0] - 2019-10-30\r\n- Refactored how conditionals treat X and Y variables.  They now need to either be passed in by value, or if passed in as a pointer they need to flagged as pointers\r\n\r\n## [1.4.12] - 2019-10-29\r\n- Built against Linked List v.1.5.9\r\n\r\n## [1.4.11] - 2019-10-29\r\n- Refactored how Test Executive Version is handled, it is now effectively hard coded and will need to be manually revisioned with each package build.\r\n\r\n## [1.4.10] - 2019-10-28\r\n- Added public API methods for reading and writing attribute meta data.\r\n\r\n## [1.4.9] - 2019-10-28\r\n- Updated Test Exec File Version to be a single integer (i.e. v1, v2...).\r\n\r\n## [1.4.8] - 2019-10-24\r\n- Added public API methods for reading and writing meta data.\r\n\r\n## [1.4.7] - 2019-10-24\r\n- Re-link and mass compile.\r\n\r\n## [1.4.6] - 2019-10-23\r\n- Built against linked list v1.5.5\r\n\r\n## [1.4.5] - 2019-10-23\r\n- Added more information to error message being generated by a failure to parse an attribute in the Unflatten method of the Executioner class\r\n\r\n## [1.4.4] - 2019-10-22\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.5.4\r\n\r\n## [1.4.3] - 2019-10-08\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.4.5\r\n\r\n## [1.4.2] - 2019-10-07\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.4.4\r\n\r\n## [1.4.1] - 2019-10-07\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.4.1\r\n\r\n## [1.4.0] - 2019-10-04\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.4.0\r\n- First release of parameterization, includes two new methods: Load Parameterized Test Executive and Create Parameterized Test Executive.\r\n\r\n## [1.3.1] - 2019-10-02\r\n- Building up the ability to parameterize test executives (work in progress)\r\n- Fixed a bug that was preventing parameterized attributes at the namespace level from propagating down into subroutines\r\n\r\n## [1.3.0] - 2019-09-13\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.2.2\r\n- Added public method for retrieving all attributes\r\n- Refactored subroutine attribute handling to allow passing values out of subroutines\r\n\r\n## [1.2.1] - 2019-09-13\r\n- No changes introduced in this build\r\n\r\n## [1.2.0] - 2019-09-13\r\n- Refactored Get Next to pass out an \"Active Test Executive\".  The primary use case for this is subroutines as it allows teststeps to gain access to subroutine data space\r\n- Fixed a bug that was preventing Subroutine (flow control element) from properly gaining the public attributes of the Subroutine (from disk) that it loads and executes\r\n\r\n## [1.1.0] - 2019-09-09\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.2.1\r\n- Refactored Insert Test to pass out a scaler \"Replaced?\" flag instead of a 1D array\r\n\r\n## [1.0.1] - 2019-09-09\r\n- Updated \"Insert\" methods to include a \"replaced?\" flag as an output to notify user that the insert replaced an existing item\r\n\r\n## [1.0.0] - 2019-09-05\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.1.4\r\n- This is a major revision of the Test Executive, it is not backwards compatible with the 0.x.x-Beta versions\r\n- Updated connector panes on public by reference methods to include required inputs where appropriate\r\n- Added file version tracking for saved tests\r\n- Added checksum verification for subroutines\r\n- Added test executive version tracking for saved tests\r\n\r\n## [0.0.47] - 2019-8-26\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.1.2\r\n- Refactored how subroutines are executed.  Subroutines are now given their own execution thread\r\n\r\n## [0.0.46] - 2019-8-20\r\n- Fixed an issue with the Stop Loop executioner not propagating out of a conditional up to a containing loop\r\n- Added a sandbox VI demonstrating stopping a loop with attributes and a conditional structure\r\n\r\n## [0.0.45] - 2019-8-20\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.0.9\r\n\r\n## [0.0.44] - 2019-8-20\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.0.8\r\n\r\n## [0.0.43] - 2019-8-19\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.0.7, which addresses Linked List [issue #4](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-linked-lists/issues/4/formatting-of-spaces-when-saving-to-xml), which fixes Test Executive [issue #21](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-test-executive/issues/21/executioner-name-is-different-as-a-result). \r\n- This build addresses Test Executive [issue #19](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-test-executive/issues/19/create-test-from-object-can-take-in-any)\r\n- This build addresses Test Executive [issue #23](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-test-executive/issues/23/test-testexecution_for)\r\n- This build addresses Test Executive [issue #20](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-test-executive/issues/20/estapi_replace-executionervi-failure)\r\n\r\n## [0.0.42] - 2019-8-01\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.0.6, which addresses Linked List [issue #3](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-linked-lists/issues/3/build-tree-data-type-is-not-working-with) - Build Tree Data Type is not working with Private Attributes.

This new Persistence package depends on a new Data Type Serialization package, which enables the consumer to use a custom type system with CAML persistence.\r\n\r\n## [1.8.2] - 2020-04-06\r\n- Refactored how the flow control classes set their execution status flags in their Get Next Override.

The \"Read From Text File\" call had \"Convert EOL\" set, which interfered with the binary string formatting for attributes.  When we make the move to Test Exec v2.x.x I will separate the concern of reading from and writing to file from the test executive all together.\r\n\r\n## [1.8.0] - 2020-03-19\r\n- Added new flow control type, \"Halt\".  Calling a \"Halt\" will cause the active namespace to stop executing.  This means that if a Halt is executed in a running subroutine, the subroutine will stop and the calling routine will continue.  If a Halt is called in a top level routine, the test executive will stop executing.\r\n\r\n## [1.7.1] - 2020-03-18\r\n- Quick patch to update Test Exec Version in API\r\n\r\n## [1.7.0] - 2020-03-17\r\n- Built against Linked List 1.6.0\r\n- Added ability to Save As with new GUIDs for the new copy.\r\n\r\n## [1.6.2] - 2020-02-19\r\n- Fixed a bug in Case Structures that were causing them to exit when an executed conditional branch contained a subroutine.\r\n- Added an improvement to how subroutines are loaded into calling routines.  If a subroutines interface changes after being inserted into a calling routine, on the next load of that calling routine the interface updates will be loaded with the subroutine.\r\n\r\n## [1.6.1] - 2020-01-07\r\n- Mass compile.\r\n\r\n## [1.6.0] - 2020-01-06\r\n- Created a new flow control type called \"Case Structure\".  The \"Case Structure\" allows for stacked IF ELSE statements, meaning that the developer can run through a chain of assertions on different variable inputs until one passes, which will cause the Conditional Branch associated with that assertion/variable pairing to execute.  There is an always include input on the Insert Case Structure method that requires that an \"Else Conditional Branch\" must be passed in, the \"Else Conditional Branch\" will run if all assertions fail.  The main difference between the Case Structure and the Conditional Structure is that the Conditional only allows for one assertion to be evaluated while the Case Structure allows for an uncapped array of assertions to be evaluated.\r\n\r\n## [1.5.3] - 2019-12-04\r\n- Added a new method for retrieving active element index without needing to draw the tree\r\n\r\n## [1.5.2] - 2019-12-04\r\n- Updated the Draw Tree utility method of the Test Exec Ref class to pass out the active element index, this works regardless of if subroutine is executing or not\r\n\r\n## [1.5.1] - 2019-12-02\r\n- Added ability to remove multiple attributes at once\r\n\r\n## [1.5.0] - 2019-10-30\r\n- Refactored how conditionals treat X and Y variables.  They now need to either be passed in by value, or if passed in as a pointer they need to flagged as pointers\r\n\r\n## [1.4.12] - 2019-10-29\r\n- Built against Linked List v.1.5.9\r\n\r\n## [1.4.11] - 2019-10-29\r\n- Refactored how Test Executive Version is handled, it is now effectively hard coded and will need to be manually revisioned with each package build.\r\n\r\n## [1.4.10] - 2019-10-28\r\n- Added public API methods for reading and writing attribute meta data.\r\n\r\n## [1.4.9] - 2019-10-28\r\n- Updated Test Exec File Version to be a single integer (i.e. v1, v2...).\r\n\r\n## [1.4.8] - 2019-10-24\r\n- Added public API methods for reading and writing meta data.\r\n\r\n## [1.4.7] - 2019-10-24\r\n- Re-link and mass compile.\r\n\r\n## [1.4.6] - 2019-10-23\r\n- Built against linked list v1.5.5\r\n\r\n## [1.4.5] - 2019-10-23\r\n- Added more information to error message being generated by a failure to parse an attribute in the Unflatten method of the Executioner class\r\n\r\n## [1.4.4] - 2019-10-22\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.5.4\r\n\r\n## [1.4.3] - 2019-10-08\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.4.5\r\n\r\n## [1.4.2] - 2019-10-07\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.4.4\r\n\r\n## [1.4.1] - 2019-10-07\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.4.1\r\n\r\n## [1.4.0] - 2019-10-04\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.4.0\r\n- First release of parameterization, includes two new methods: Load Parameterized Test Executive and Create Parameterized Test Executive.\r\n\r\n## [1.3.1] - 2019-10-02\r\n- Building up the ability to parameterize test executives (work in progress)\r\n- Fixed a bug that was preventing parameterized attributes at the namespace level from propagating down into subroutines\r\n\r\n## [1.3.0] - 2019-09-13\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.2.2\r\n- Added public method for retrieving all attributes\r\n- Refactored subroutine attribute handling to allow passing values out of subroutines\r\n\r\n## [1.2.1] - 2019-09-13\r\n- No changes introduced in this build\r\n\r\n## [1.2.0] - 2019-09-13\r\n- Refactored Get Next to pass out an \"Active Test Executive\".  The primary use case for this is subroutines as it allows teststeps to gain access to subroutine data space\r\n- Fixed a bug that was preventing Subroutine (flow control element) from properly gaining the public attributes of the Subroutine (from disk) that it loads and executes\r\n\r\n## [1.1.0] - 2019-09-09\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.2.1\r\n- Refactored Insert Test to pass out a scaler \"Replaced?\" flag instead of a 1D array\r\n\r\n## [1.0.1] - 2019-09-09\r\n- Updated \"Insert\" methods to include a \"replaced?\" flag as an output to notify user that the insert replaced an existing item\r\n\r\n## [1.0.0] - 2019-09-05\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.1.4\r\n- This is a major revision of the Test Executive, it is not backwards compatible with the 0.x.x-Beta versions\r\n- Updated connector panes on public by reference methods to include required inputs where appropriate\r\n- Added file version tracking for saved tests\r\n- Added checksum verification for subroutines\r\n- Added test executive version tracking for saved tests\r\n\r\n## [0.0.47] - 2019-8-26\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.1.2\r\n- Refactored how subroutines are executed.

          "Release Notes": "## [1.9.1] - 2020-05-04\r\n- Fixed a linking issue against the old persistence type in the paramterization methods.\r\n\r\n## [1.9.0] - 2020-05-04\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.7.0, which includes a new dependency on a persistence G Package (it used to be bundled up inside the Linked List package but I pulled it out).  This new Persistence package depends on a new Data Type Serialization package, which enables the consumer to use a custom type system with CAML persistence.\r\n\r\n## [1.8.2] - 2020-04-06\r\n- Refactored how the flow control classes set their execution status flags in their Get Next Override.  This was done to fix a bug where calling Halt inside a loop would stop the loop but not Halt the name space (The loop types were treating Halt just like the Stop Loop flow control type).\r\n\r\n## [1.8.1] - 2020-04-01\r\n- Fixed a bug in Insert Subroutine.  The \"Read From Text File\" call had \"Convert EOL\" set, which interfered with the binary string formatting for attributes.  When we make the move to Test Exec v2.x.x I will separate the concern of reading from and writing to file from the test executive all together.\r\n\r\n## [1.8.0] - 2020-03-19\r\n- Added new flow control type, \"Halt\".  Calling a \"Halt\" will cause the active namespace to stop executing.  This means that if a Halt is executed in a running subroutine, the subroutine will stop and the calling routine will continue.  If a Halt is called in a top level routine, the test executive will stop executing.\r\n\r\n## [1.7.1] - 2020-03-18\r\n- Quick patch to update Test Exec Version in API\r\n\r\n## [1.7.0] - 2020-03-17\r\n- Built against Linked List 1.6.0\r\n- Added ability to Save As with new GUIDs for the new copy.\r\n\r\n## [1.6.2] - 2020-02-19\r\n- Fixed a bug in Case Structures that were causing them to exit when an executed conditional branch contained a subroutine.\r\n- Added an improvement to how subroutines are loaded into calling routines.  If a subroutines interface changes after being inserted into a calling routine, on the next load of that calling routine the interface updates will be loaded with the subroutine.\r\n\r\n## [1.6.1] - 2020-01-07\r\n- Mass compile.\r\n\r\n## [1.6.0] - 2020-01-06\r\n- Created a new flow control type called \"Case Structure\".  The \"Case Structure\" allows for stacked IF ELSE statements, meaning that the developer can run through a chain of assertions on different variable inputs until one passes, which will cause the Conditional Branch associated with that assertion/variable pairing to execute.  There is an always include input on the Insert Case Structure method that requires that an \"Else Conditional Branch\" must be passed in, the \"Else Conditional Branch\" will run if all assertions fail.  The main difference between the Case Structure and the Conditional Structure is that the Conditional only allows for one assertion to be evaluated while the Case Structure allows for an uncapped array of assertions to be evaluated.\r\n\r\n## [1.5.3] - 2019-12-04\r\n- Added a new method for retrieving active element index without needing to draw the tree\r\n\r\n## [1.5.2] - 2019-12-04\r\n- Updated the Draw Tree utility method of the Test Exec Ref class to pass out the active element index, this works regardless of if subroutine is executing or not\r\n\r\n## [1.5.1] - 2019-12-02\r\n- Added ability to remove multiple attributes at once\r\n\r\n## [1.5.0] - 2019-10-30\r\n- Refactored how conditionals treat X and Y variables.

          "Release Notes": "## [1.9.6] - 2020-05-12\r\n- Depends on Linked List v1.7.5.\r\n\r\n## [1.9.5] - 2020-05-11\r\n- Depends on Linked List v1.7.4.\r\n\r\n## [1.9.4] - 2020-05-05\r\n- Depends on Linked List v1.7.1.\r\n\r\n## [1.9.3] - 2020-05-04\r\n- Added a new method for relinking top level routines to subroutines.\r\n\r\n## [1.9.2] - 2020-05-04\r\n- Fixed a linking issue against the old persistence type in the paramterization methods.\r\n\r\n## [1.9.1] - 2020-05-04\r\n- Fixed a linking issue against the old persistence type in the paramterization methods.\r\n\r\n## [1.9.0] - 2020-05-04\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.7.0, which includes a new dependency on a persistence G Package (it used to be bundled up inside the Linked List package but I pulled it out).  This new Persistence package depends on a new Data Type Serialization package, which enables the consumer to use a custom type system with CAML persistence.\r\n\r\n## [1.8.2] - 2020-04-06\r\n- Refactored how the flow control classes set their execution status flags in their Get Next Override.  This was done to fix a bug where calling Halt inside a loop would stop the loop but not Halt the name space (The loop types were treating Halt just like the Stop Loop flow control type).\r\n\r\n## [1.8.1] - 2020-04-01\r\n- Fixed a bug in Insert Subroutine.  The \"Read From Text File\" call had \"Convert EOL\" set, which interfered with the binary string formatting for attributes.  When we make the move to Test Exec v2.x.x I will separate the concern of reading from and writing to file from the test executive all together.\r\n\r\n## [1.8.0] - 2020-03-19\r\n- Added new flow control type, \"Halt\".  Calling a \"Halt\" will cause the active namespace to stop executing.  This means that if a Halt is executed in a running subroutine, the subroutine will stop and the calling routine will continue.  If a Halt is called in a top level routine, the test executive will stop executing.\r\n\r\n## [1.7.1] - 2020-03-18\r\n- Quick patch to update Test Exec Version in API\r\n\r\n## [1.7.0] - 2020-03-17\r\n- Built against Linked List 1.6.0\r\n- Added ability to Save As with new GUIDs for the new copy.\r\n\r\n## [1.6.2] - 2020-02-19\r\n- Fixed a bug in Case Structures that were causing them to exit when an executed conditional branch contained a subroutine.\r\n- Added an improvement to how subroutines are loaded into calling routines.  If a subroutines interface changes after being inserted into a calling routine, on the next load of that calling routine the interface updates will be loaded with the subroutine.\r\n\r\n## [1.6.1] - 2020-01-07\r\n- Mass compile.\r\n\r\n## [1.6.0] - 2020-01-06\r\n- Created a new flow control type called \"Case Structure\".  The \"Case Structure\" allows for stacked IF ELSE statements, meaning that the developer can run through a chain of assertions on different variable inputs until one passes, which will cause the Conditional Branch associated with that assertion/variable pairing to execute.  There is an always include input on the Insert Case Structure method that requires that an \"Else Conditional Branch\" must be passed in, the \"Else Conditional Branch\" will run if all assertions fail.  The main difference between the Case Structure and the Conditional Structure is that the Conditional only allows for one assertion to be evaluated while the Case Structure allows for an uncapped array of assertions to be evaluated.\r\n\r\n## [1.5.3] - 2019-12-04\r\n- Added a new method for retrieving active element index without needing to draw the tree\r\n\r\n## [1.5.2] - 2019-12-04\r\n- Updated the Draw Tree utility method of the Test Exec Ref class to pass out the active element index, this works regardless of if subroutine is executing or not\r\n\r\n## [1.5.1] - 2019-12-02\r\n- Added ability to remove multiple attributes at once\r\n\r\n## [1.5.0] - 2019-10-30\r\n- Refactored how conditionals treat X and Y variables.  They now need to either be passed in by value, or if passed in as a pointer they need to flagged as pointers\r\n\r\n## [1.4.12] - 2019-10-29\r\n- Built against Linked List v.1.5.9\r\n\r\n## [1.4.11] - 2019-10-29\r\n- Refactored how Test Executive Version is handled, it is now effectively hard coded and will need to be manually revisioned with each package build.\r\n\r\n## [1.4.10] - 2019-10-28\r\n- Added public API methods for reading and writing attribute meta data.\r\n\r\n## [1.4.9] - 2019-10-28\r\n- Updated Test Exec File Version to be a single integer (i.e. v1, v2...).\r\n\r\n## [1.4.8] - 2019-10-24\r\n- Added public API methods for reading and writing meta data.\r\n\r\n## [1.4.7] - 2019-10-24\r\n- Re-link and mass compile.\r\n\r\n## [1.4.6] - 2019-10-23\r\n- Built against linked list v1.5.5\r\n\r\n## [1.4.5] - 2019-10-23\r\n- Added more information to error message being generated by a failure to parse an attribute in the Unflatten method of the Executioner class\r\n\r\n## [1.4.4] - 2019-10-22\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.5.4\r\n\r\n## [1.4.3] - 2019-10-08\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.4.5\r\n\r\n## [1.4.2] - 2019-10-07\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.4.4\r\n\r\n## [1.4.1] - 2019-10-07\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.4.1\r\n\r\n## [1.4.0] - 2019-10-04\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.4.0\r\n- First release of parameterization, includes two new methods: Load Parameterized Test Executive and Create Parameterized Test Executive.\r\n\r\n## [1.3.1] - 2019-10-02\r\n- Building up the ability to parameterize test executives (work in progress)\r\n- Fixed a bug that was preventing parameterized attributes at the namespace level from propagating down into subroutines\r\n\r\n## [1.3.0] - 2019-09-13\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.2.2\r\n- Added public method for retrieving all attributes\r\n- Refactored subroutine attribute handling to allow passing values out of subroutines\r\n\r\n## [1.2.1] - 2019-09-13\r\n- No changes introduced in this build\r\n\r\n## [1.2.0] - 2019-09-13\r\n- Refactored Get Next to pass out an \"Active Test Executive\".  The primary use case for this is subroutines as it allows teststeps to gain access to subroutine data space\r\n- Fixed a bug that was preventing Subroutine (flow control element) from properly gaining the public attributes of the Subroutine (from disk) that it loads and executes\r\n\r\n## [1.1.0] - 2019-09-09\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.2.1\r\n- Refactored Insert Test to pass out a scaler \"Replaced?\" flag instead of a 1D array\r\n\r\n## [1.0.1] - 2019-09-09\r\n- Updated \"Insert\" methods to include a \"replaced?\" flag as an output to notify user that the insert replaced an existing item\r\n\r\n## [1.0.0] - 2019-09-05\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.1.4\r\n- This is a major revision of the Test Executive, it is not backwards compatible with the 0.x.x-Beta versions\r\n- Updated connector panes on public by reference methods to include required inputs where appropriate\r\n- Added file version tracking for saved tests\r\n- Added checksum verification for subroutines\r\n- Added test executive version tracking for saved tests\r\n\r\n## [0.0.47] - 2019-8-26\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.1.2\r\n- Refactored how subroutines are executed.  Subroutines are now given their own execution thread\r\n\r\n## [0.0.46] - 2019-8-20\r\n- Fixed an issue with the Stop Loop executioner not propagating out of a conditional up to a containing loop\r\n- Added a sandbox VI demonstrating stopping a loop with attributes and a conditional structure\r\n\r\n## [0.0.45] - 2019-8-20\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.0.9\r\n\r\n## [0.0.44] - 2019-8-20\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.0.8\r\n\r\n## [0.0.43] - 2019-8-19\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.0.7, which addresses Linked List [issue #4](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-linked-lists/issues/4/formatting-of-spaces-when-saving-to-xml), which fixes Test Executive [issue #21](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-test-executive/issues/21/executioner-name-is-different-as-a-result). \r\n- This build addresses Test Executive [issue #19](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-test-executive/issues/19/create-test-from-object-can-take-in-any)\r\n- This build addresses Test Executive [issue #23](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-test-executive/issues/23/test-testexecution_for)\r\n- This build addresses Test Executive [issue #20](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-test-executive/issues/20/estapi_replace-executionervi-failure)\r\n\r\n## [0.0.42] - 2019-8-01\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.0.6, which addresses Linked List [issue #3](https://bitbucket.org/composedsystems/composed-linked-lists/issues/3/build-tree-data-type-is-not-working-with) - Build Tree Data Type is not working with Private Attributes.

          "Release Notes": "## [1.10.0] - 2020-06-23\r\n- Adding Parallel flow control type.\r\n\r\n## [1.9.6] - 2020-05-12\r\n- Depends on Linked List v1.7.5.\r\n\r\n## [1.9.5] - 2020-05-11\r\n- Depends on Linked List v1.7.4.\r\n\r\n## [1.9.4] - 2020-05-05\r\n- Depends on Linked List v1.7.1.\r\n\r\n## [1.9.3] - 2020-05-04\r\n- Added a new method for relinking top level routines to subroutines.\r\n\r\n## [1.9.2] - 2020-05-04\r\n- Fixed a linking issue against the old persistence type in the paramterization methods.\r\n\r\n## [1.9.1] - 2020-05-04\r\n- Fixed a linking issue against the old persistence type in the paramterization methods.\r\n\r\n## [1.9.0] - 2020-05-04\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.7.0, which includes a new dependency on a persistence G Package (it used to be bundled up inside the Linked List package but I pulled it out).  This new Persistence package depends on a new Data Type Serialization package, which enables the consumer to use a custom type system with CAML persistence.\r\n\r\n## [1.8.2] - 2020-04-06\r\n- Refactored how the flow control classes set their execution status flags in their Get Next Override.  This was done to fix a bug where calling Halt inside a loop would stop the loop but not Halt the name space (The loop types were treating Halt just like the Stop Loop flow control type).\r\n\r\n## [1.8.1] - 2020-04-01\r\n- Fixed a bug in Insert Subroutine.  The \"Read From Text File\" call had \"Convert EOL\" set, which interfered with the binary string formatting for attributes.  When we make the move to Test Exec v2.x.x I will separate the concern of reading from and writing to file from the test executive all together.\r\n\r\n## [1.8.0] - 2020-03-19\r\n- Added new flow control type, \"Halt\".  Calling a \"Halt\" will cause the active namespace to stop executing.  This means that if a Halt is executed in a running subroutine, the subroutine will stop and the calling routine will continue.  If a Halt is called in a top level routine, the test executive will stop executing.\r\n\r\n## [1.7.1] - 2020-03-18\r\n- Quick patch to update Test Exec Version in API\r\n\r\n## [1.7.0] - 2020-03-17\r\n- Built against Linked List 1.6.0\r\n- Added ability to Save As with new GUIDs for the new copy.\r\n\r\n## [1.6.2] - 2020-02-19\r\n- Fixed a bug in Case Structures that were causing them to exit when an executed conditional branch contained a subroutine.\r\n- Added an improvement to how subroutines are loaded into calling routines.  If a subroutines interface changes after being inserted into a calling routine, on the next load of that calling routine the interface updates will be loaded with the subroutine.\r\n\r\n## [1.6.1] - 2020-01-07\r\n- Mass compile.\r\n\r\n## [1.6.0] - 2020-01-06\r\n- Created a new flow control type called \"Case Structure\".  The \"Case Structure\" allows for stacked IF ELSE statements, meaning that the developer can run through a chain of assertions on different variable inputs until one passes, which will cause the Conditional Branch associated with that assertion/variable pairing to execute.  There is an always include input on the Insert Case Structure method that requires that an \"Else Conditional Branch\" must be passed in, the \"Else Conditional Branch\" will run if all assertions fail.  The main difference between the Case Structure and the Conditional Structure is that the Conditional only allows for one assertion to be evaluated while the Case Structure allows for an uncapped array of assertions to be evaluated.\r\n\r\n## [1.5.3] - 2019-12-04\r\n- Added a new method for retrieving active element index without needing to draw the tree\r\n\r\n## [1.5.2] - 2019-12-04\r\n- Updated the Draw Tree utility method of the Test Exec Ref class to pass out the active element index, this works regardless of if subroutine is executing or not\r\n\r\n## [1.5.1] - 2019-12-02\r\n- Added ability to remove multiple attributes at once\r\n\r\n## [1.5.0] - 2019-10-30\r\n- Refactored how conditionals treat X and Y variables.  They now need to either be passed in by value, or if passed in as a pointer they need to flagged as pointers\r\n\r\n## [1.4.12] - 2019-10-29\r\n- Built against Linked List v.1.5.9\r\n\r\n## [1.4.11] - 2019-10-29\r\n- Refactored how Test Executive Version is handled, it is now effectively hard coded and will need to be manually revisioned with each package build.\r\n\r\n## [1.4.10] - 2019-10-28\r\n- Added public API methods for reading and writing attribute meta data.\r\n\r\n## [1.4.9] - 2019-10-28\r\n- Updated Test Exec File Version to be a single integer (i.e. v1, v2...).\r\n\r\n## [1.4.8] - 2019-10-24\r\n- Added public API methods for reading and writing meta data.\r\n\r\n## [1.4.7] - 2019-10-24\r\n- Re-link and mass compile.\r\n\r\n## [1.4.6] - 2019-10-23\r\n- Built against linked list v1.5.5\r\n\r\n## [1.4.5] - 2019-10-23\r\n- Added more information to error message being generated by a failure to parse an attribute in the Unflatten method of the Executioner class\r\n\r\n## [1.4.4] - 2019-10-22\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.5.4\r\n\r\n## [1.4.3] - 2019-10-08\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.4.5\r\n\r\n## [1.4.2] - 2019-10-07\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.4.4\r\n\r\n## [1.4.1] - 2019-10-07\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.4.1\r\n\r\n## [1.4.0] - 2019-10-04\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.4.0\r\n- First release of parameterization, includes two new methods: Load Parameterized Test Executive and Create Parameterized Test Executive.\r\n\r\n## [1.3.1] - 2019-10-02\r\n- Building up the ability to parameterize test executives (work in progress)\r\n- Fixed a bug that was preventing parameterized attributes at the namespace level from propagating down into subroutines\r\n\r\n## [1.3.0] - 2019-09-13\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.2.2\r\n- Added public method for retrieving all attributes\r\n- Refactored subroutine attribute handling to allow passing values out of subroutines\r\n\r\n## [1.2.1] - 2019-09-13\r\n- No changes introduced in this build\r\n\r\n## [1.2.0] - 2019-09-13\r\n- Refactored Get Next to pass out an \"Active Test Executive\".

          "Release Notes": "## [1.8.0] - 2020-03-19\r\n- Added new flow control type, \"Halt\".  Calling a \"Halt\" will cause the active namespace to stop executing.  This means that if a Halt is executed in a running subroutine, the subroutine will stop and the calling routine will continue.  If a Halt is called in a top level routine, the test executive will stop executing.\r\n\r\n## [1.7.1] - 2020-03-18\r\n- Quick patch to update Test Exec Version in API\r\n\r\n## [1.7.0] - 2020-03-17\r\n- Built against Linked List 1.6.0\r\n- Added ability to Save As with new GUIDs for the new copy.\r\n\r\n## [1.6.2] - 2020-02-19\r\n- Fixed a bug in Case Structures that were causing them to exit when an executed conditional branch contained a subroutine.\r\n- Added an improvement to how subroutines are loaded into calling routines.  If a subroutines interface changes after being inserted into a calling routine, on the next load of that calling routine the interface updates will be loaded with the subroutine.\r\n\r\n## [1.6.1] - 2020-01-07\r\n- Mass compile.\r\n\r\n## [1.6.0] - 2020-01-06\r\n- Created a new flow control type called \"Case Structure\".  The \"Case Structure\" allows for stacked IF ELSE statements, meaning that the developer can run through a chain of assertions on different variable inputs until one passes, which will cause the Conditional Branch associated with that assertion/variable pairing to execute.  There is an always include input on the Insert Case Structure method that requires that an \"Else Conditional Branch\" must be passed in, the \"Else Conditional Branch\" will run if all assertions fail.

          "Release Notes": "## [1.9.5] - 2020-05-11\r\n- Depends on Linked List v1.7.4.\r\n\r\n## [1.9.4] - 2020-05-05\r\n- Depends on Linked List v1.7.1.\r\n\r\n## [1.9.3] - 2020-05-04\r\n- Added a new method for relinking top level routines to subroutines.\r\n\r\n## [1.9.2] - 2020-05-04\r\n- Fixed a linking issue against the old persistence type in the paramterization methods.\r\n\r\n## [1.9.1] - 2020-05-04\r\n- Fixed a linking issue against the old persistence type in the paramterization methods.\r\n\r\n## [1.9.0] - 2020-05-04\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.7.0, which includes a new dependency on a persistence G Package (it used to be bundled up inside the Linked List package but I pulled it out).  This new Persistence package depends on a new Data Type Serialization package, which enables the consumer to use a custom type system with CAML persistence.\r\n\r\n## [1.8.2] - 2020-04-06\r\n- Refactored how the flow control classes set their execution status flags in their Get Next Override.  This was done to fix a bug where calling Halt inside a loop would stop the loop but not Halt the name space (The loop types were treating Halt just like the Stop Loop flow control type).\r\n\r\n## [1.8.1] - 2020-04-01\r\n- Fixed a bug in Insert Subroutine.  The \"Read From Text File\" call had \"Convert EOL\" set, which interfered with the binary string formatting for attributes.  When we make the move to Test Exec v2.x.x I will separate the concern of reading from and writing to file from the test executive all together.\r\n\r\n## [1.8.0] - 2020-03-19\r\n- Added new flow control type, \"Halt\".  Calling a \"Halt\" will cause the active namespace to stop executing.  This means that if a Halt is executed in a running subroutine, the subroutine will stop and the calling routine will continue.  If a Halt is called in a top level routine, the test executive will stop executing.\r\n\r\n## [1.7.1] - 2020-03-18\r\n- Quick patch to update Test Exec Version in API\r\n\r\n## [1.7.0] - 2020-03-17\r\n- Built against Linked List 1.6.0\r\n- Added ability to Save As with new GUIDs for the new copy.\r\n\r\n## [1.6.2] - 2020-02-19\r\n- Fixed a bug in Case Structures that were causing them to exit when an executed conditional branch contained a subroutine.\r\n- Added an improvement to how subroutines are loaded into calling routines.  If a subroutines interface changes after being inserted into a calling routine, on the next load of that calling routine the interface updates will be loaded with the subroutine.\r\n\r\n## [1.6.1] - 2020-01-07\r\n- Mass compile.\r\n\r\n## [1.6.0] - 2020-01-06\r\n- Created a new flow control type called \"Case Structure\".  The \"Case Structure\" allows for stacked IF ELSE statements, meaning that the developer can run through a chain of assertions on different variable inputs until one passes, which will cause the Conditional Branch associated with that assertion/variable pairing to execute.  There is an always include input on the Insert Case Structure method that requires that an \"Else Conditional Branch\" must be passed in, the \"Else Conditional Branch\" will run if all assertions fail.  The main difference between the Case Structure and the Conditional Structure is that the Conditional only allows for one assertion to be evaluated while the Case Structure allows for an uncapped array of assertions to be evaluated.\r\n\r\n## [1.5.3] - 2019-12-04\r\n- Added a new method for retrieving active element index without needing to draw the tree\r\n\r\n## [1.5.2] - 2019-12-04\r\n- Updated the Draw Tree utility method of the Test Exec Ref class to pass out the active element index, this works regardless of if subroutine is executing or not\r\n\r\n## [1.5.1] - 2019-12-02\r\n- Added ability to remove multiple attributes at once\r\n\r\n## [1.5.0] - 2019-10-30\r\n- Refactored how conditionals treat X and Y variables.  They now need to either be passed in by value, or if passed in as a pointer they need to flagged as pointers\r\n\r\n## [1.4.12] - 2019-10-29\r\n- Built against Linked List v.1.5.9\r\n\r\n## [1.4.11] - 2019-10-29\r\n- Refactored how Test Executive Version is handled, it is now effectively hard coded and will need to be manually revisioned with each package build.\r\n\r\n## [1.4.10] - 2019-10-28\r\n- Added public API methods for reading and writing attribute meta data.\r\n\r\n## [1.4.9] - 2019-10-28\r\n- Updated Test Exec File Version to be a single integer (i.e. v1, v2...).\r\n\r\n## [1.4.8] - 2019-10-24\r\n- Added public API methods for reading and writing meta data.\r\n\r\n## [1.4.7] - 2019-10-24\r\n- Re-link and mass compile.\r\n\r\n## [1.4.6] - 2019-10-23\r\n- Built against linked list v1.5.5\r\n\r\n## [1.4.5] - 2019-10-23\r\n- Added more information to error message being generated by a failure to parse an attribute in the Unflatten method of the Executioner class\r\n\r\n## [1.4.4] - 2019-10-22\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.5.4\r\n\r\n## [1.4.3] - 2019-10-08\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.4.5\r\n\r\n## [1.4.2] - 2019-10-07\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.4.4\r\n\r\n## [1.4.1] - 2019-10-07\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.4.1\r\n\r\n## [1.4.0] - 2019-10-04\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.4.0\r\n- First release of parameterization, includes two new methods: Load Parameterized Test Executive and Create Parameterized Test Executive.\r\n\r\n## [1.3.1] - 2019-10-02\r\n- Building up the ability to parameterize test executives (work in progress)\r\n- Fixed a bug that was preventing parameterized attributes at the namespace level from propagating down into subroutines\r\n\r\n## [1.3.0] - 2019-09-13\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.2.2\r\n- Added public method for retrieving all attributes\r\n- Refactored subroutine attribute handling to allow passing values out of subroutines\r\n\r\n## [1.2.1] - 2019-09-13\r\n- No changes introduced in this build\r\n\r\n## [1.2.0] - 2019-09-13\r\n- Refactored Get Next to pass out an \"Active Test Executive\".

          "Release Notes": "## [1.8.2] - 2020-04-06\r\n- Refactored how the flow control classes set their execution status flags in their Get Next Override.  This was done to fix a bug where calling Halt inside a loop would stop the loop but not Halt the name space (The loop types were treating Halt just like the Stop Loop flow control type).\r\n\r\n## [1.8.1] - 2020-04-01\r\n- Fixed a bug in Insert Subroutine.  The \"Read From Text File\" call had \"Convert EOL\" set, which interfered with the binary string formatting for attributes.  When we make the move to Test Exec v2.x.x I will separate the concern of reading from and writing to file from the test executive all together.\r\n\r\n## [1.8.0] - 2020-03-19\r\n- Added new flow control type, \"Halt\".  Calling a \"Halt\" will cause the active namespace to stop executing.  This means that if a Halt is executed in a running subroutine, the subroutine will stop and the calling routine will continue.  If a Halt is called in a top level routine, the test executive will stop executing.\r\n\r\n## [1.7.1] - 2020-03-18\r\n- Quick patch to update Test Exec Version in API\r\n\r\n## [1.7.0] - 2020-03-17\r\n- Built against Linked List 1.6.0\r\n- Added ability to Save As with new GUIDs for the new copy.\r\n\r\n## [1.6.2] - 2020-02-19\r\n- Fixed a bug in Case Structures that were causing them to exit when an executed conditional branch contained a subroutine.\r\n- Added an improvement to how subroutines are loaded into calling routines.  If a subroutines interface changes after being inserted into a calling routine, on the next load of that calling routine the interface updates will be loaded with the subroutine.\r\n\r\n## [1.6.1] - 2020-01-07\r\n- Mass compile.\r\n\r\n## [1.6.0] - 2020-01-06\r\n- Created a new flow control type called \"Case Structure\".  The \"Case Structure\" allows for stacked IF ELSE statements, meaning that the developer can run through a chain of assertions on different variable inputs until one passes, which will cause the Conditional Branch associated with that assertion/variable pairing to execute.  There is an always include input on the Insert Case Structure method that requires that an \"Else Conditional Branch\" must be passed in, the \"Else Conditional Branch\" will run if all assertions fail.  The main difference between the Case Structure and the Conditional Structure is that the Conditional only allows for one assertion to be evaluated while the Case Structure allows for an uncapped array of assertions to be evaluated.\r\n\r\n## [1.5.3] - 2019-12-04\r\n- Added a new method for retrieving active element index without needing to draw the tree\r\n\r\n## [1.5.2] - 2019-12-04\r\n- Updated the Draw Tree utility method of the Test Exec Ref class to pass out the active element index, this works regardless of if subroutine is executing or not\r\n\r\n## [1.5.1] - 2019-12-02\r\n- Added ability to remove multiple attributes at once\r\n\r\n## [1.5.0] - 2019-10-30\r\n- Refactored how conditionals treat X and Y variables.

          "Release Notes": "## [1.9.0] - 2020-05-04\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.7.0, which includes a new dependency on a persistence G Package (it used to be bundled up inside the Linked List package but I pulled it out).  This new Persistence package depends on a new Data Type Serialization package, which enables the consumer to use a custom type system with CAML persistence.\r\n\r\n## [1.8.2] - 2020-04-06\r\n- Refactored how the flow control classes set their execution status flags in their Get Next Override.  This was done to fix a bug where calling Halt inside a loop would stop the loop but not Halt the name space (The loop types were treating Halt just like the Stop Loop flow control type).\r\n\r\n## [1.8.1] - 2020-04-01\r\n- Fixed a bug in Insert Subroutine.  The \"Read From Text File\" call had \"Convert EOL\" set, which interfered with the binary string formatting for attributes.  When we make the move to Test Exec v2.x.x I will separate the concern of reading from and writing to file from the test executive all together.\r\n\r\n## [1.8.0] - 2020-03-19\r\n- Added new flow control type, \"Halt\".  Calling a \"Halt\" will cause the active namespace to stop executing.  This means that if a Halt is executed in a running subroutine, the subroutine will stop and the calling routine will continue.  If a Halt is called in a top level routine, the test executive will stop executing.\r\n\r\n## [1.7.1] - 2020-03-18\r\n- Quick patch to update Test Exec Version in API\r\n\r\n## [1.7.0] - 2020-03-17\r\n- Built against Linked List 1.6.0\r\n- Added ability to Save As with new GUIDs for the new copy.\r\n\r\n## [1.6.2] - 2020-02-19\r\n- Fixed a bug in Case Structures that were causing them to exit when an executed conditional branch contained a subroutine.\r\n- Added an improvement to how subroutines are loaded into calling routines.  If a subroutines interface changes after being inserted into a calling routine, on the next load of that calling routine the interface updates will be loaded with the subroutine.\r\n\r\n## [1.6.1] - 2020-01-07\r\n- Mass compile.\r\n\r\n## [1.6.0] - 2020-01-06\r\n- Created a new flow control type called \"Case Structure\".  The \"Case Structure\" allows for stacked IF ELSE statements, meaning that the developer can run through a chain of assertions on different variable inputs until one passes, which will cause the Conditional Branch associated with that assertion/variable pairing to execute.  There is an always include input on the Insert Case Structure method that requires that an \"Else Conditional Branch\" must be passed in, the \"Else Conditional Branch\" will run if all assertions fail.  The main difference between the Case Structure and the Conditional Structure is that the Conditional only allows for one assertion to be evaluated while the Case Structure allows for an uncapped array of assertions to be evaluated.\r\n\r\n## [1.5.3] - 2019-12-04\r\n- Added a new method for retrieving active element index without needing to draw the tree\r\n\r\n## [1.5.2] - 2019-12-04\r\n- Updated the Draw Tree utility method of the Test Exec Ref class to pass out the active element index, this works regardless of if subroutine is executing or not\r\n\r\n## [1.5.1] - 2019-12-02\r\n- Added ability to remove multiple attributes at once\r\n\r\n## [1.5.0] - 2019-10-30\r\n- Refactored how conditionals treat X and Y variables.  They now need to either be passed in by value, or if passed in as a pointer they need to flagged as pointers\r\n\r\n## [1.4.12] - 2019-10-29\r\n- Built against Linked List v.1.5.9\r\n\r\n## [1.4.11] - 2019-10-29\r\n- Refactored how Test Executive Version is handled, it is now effectively hard coded and will need to be manually revisioned with each package build.\r\n\r\n## [1.4.10] - 2019-10-28\r\n- Added public API methods for reading and writing attribute meta data.\r\n\r\n## [1.4.9] - 2019-10-28\r\n- Updated Test Exec File Version to be a single integer (i.e. v1, v2...).\r\n\r\n## [1.4.8] - 2019-10-24\r\n- Added public API methods for reading and writing meta data.\r\n\r\n## [1.4.7] - 2019-10-24\r\n- Re-link and mass compile.\r\n\r\n## [1.4.6] - 2019-10-23\r\n- Built against linked list v1.5.5\r\n\r\n## [1.4.5] - 2019-10-23\r\n- Added more information to error message being generated by a failure to parse an attribute in the Unflatten method of the Executioner class\r\n\r\n## [1.4.4] - 2019-10-22\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.5.4\r\n\r\n## [1.4.3] - 2019-10-08\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.4.5\r\n\r\n## [1.4.2] - 2019-10-07\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.4.4\r\n\r\n## [1.4.1] - 2019-10-07\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.4.1\r\n\r\n## [1.4.0] - 2019-10-04\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.4.0\r\n- First release of parameterization, includes two new methods: Load Parameterized Test Executive and Create Parameterized Test Executive.\r\n\r\n## [1.3.1] - 2019-10-02\r\n- Building up the ability to parameterize test executives (work in progress)\r\n- Fixed a bug that was preventing parameterized attributes at the namespace level from propagating down into subroutines\r\n\r\n## [1.3.0] - 2019-09-13\r\n- Built against Linked List v1.2.2\r\n- Added public method for retrieving all attributes\r\n- Refactored subroutine attribute handling to allow passing values out of subroutines\r\n\r\n## [1.2.1] - 2019-09-13\r\n- No changes introduced in this build\r\n\r\n## [1.2.0] - 2019-09-13\r\n- Refactored Get Next to pass out an \"Active Test Executive\".
